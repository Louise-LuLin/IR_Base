Or should I say Emperor.  Caesar's Palace set out to create pure decadence and gluttony and succeeded on so many levels.  Of course the ancient romans had the vomitoriums ( a practice frowned upon in modern day Vegas) and could probably eat much more than we can.  I don't even mind the price or the long lines. Realistically, to get the same quality food for dinner you would pay as much if not more per person and have far less food. Here is the best tip ever.  If you want to pay only 27 dollars per person and have almost no line, do midweek lunch.  You will miss the fresh crab legs and a few carving choices but the rest of the food is amazing from the lobster bisque and clam chowder, shrimp and grits, fresh Italian meat choices, Wagyu Beef sliders that are the best sliders I have ever tasted.  The waitresses are pleasant but the best staff members are those behind the counter making the food and explaining it to the customers.  Don't be afraid to ask.\n\nMy favorites are:\n\nItalian Meats - 7 varieties of salami, proscuitto, etc.  The cheese selection is a little thin and could use a soft cheese choice.\n\nThe oriental duck and pork - right next to the sushi. (BTW yesterday I had some amazing shrimp tempura sushi.)\n\nWagyu Beef Sliders and Sweet Potato Tots.\n\nChicken Wings\n\nLobster Bisque and Clam Chowder\n\nShrimp Gritz\n\nPaella\n\nSpecialty sausage\n\nSlab bacon. (don't ask, just try it. And don't worry about the calories).\n\nThe desert bar is a treat of its own with amazing gelato flavors and a seemingly endless variety of chocolate delights.  They have watermelon mint, sour cherry, spicy chocolate, etc.\n\nFor dinner they have king crab legs made right in front of you, more meat variety including Lamb and Veal, and well, more food.\n\nThis is the finest buffet in Vegas and in my top 10 of Vegas dining must goes.","review_id":"QGEFe2VwhS5CSmSvaYFaig","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw","date":"2012-12-12"},{"cool":3,"text":"Man, I feel bad that I didn't really enjoy this place that much. It kinda makes me feel like a contrarian but it's my honest opinion.\n\nThis new buffet is supposed to rival all the other high-end buffets in town such as Bellagio, Wynn, and the M. Although it is definitely not your average buffet, I don't think it's as good as any of the above mentioned ones on their worst days. This buffet didn't have that \"wow\" factor I was expecting, especially after having that when I first ate at each of those previously mentioned.\n\nIt was not all bad but I would like to point the things that determined my 3.5 rating:\n\nKing crab legs were still frozen. Not sure if some of the pieces had been sitting on the ice for too long or if they came out that way. Stone crab legs were dry and bland. Oysters were not that fresh even though I observed some guys shucking them behind the line :-/ Some of the labels were missing and or wrong for the food items and that's just a pet peeve of mine. Sushi and Chinese stations had your usual suspects, nothing that really stood out.\n\nOkay enough of the bad, let's talk about the good/must haves:\n\nCheddar broccoli in the American section was the best type of broccoli I have ever had. It was kinda crunchy from being baked, with gooey, greasy cheddar cheese melted on them. Wow. Italian meatballs were perfectly flavored. Sop up the extra marinara with a garlic knot. Prime rib was good, had the nice peppered crust on the outside that I just love. Lamb chops were good, no mint jelly needed. Not gamey at all. Mexican station had this awesome grilled pineapple and jicama salad. Chinese station had a peppered beef with asparagus and dim sum that were pretty good. There was a pho/ramen station that I didn't get to try but I thought it was cool that they offered that. Nutella crepe made to order was yummy and the buttered caramel gelato has to be my new favorite flavor. So rich and buttery, you need to have a drink handy. That sweetness will sit in the back of your throat and tickle if you don't wash it down.\n\nOkay, so that was my review. I think everybody should still go check this place out and I hope you all have a wonderful experience if you do. I think I was expecting too much because of my past experiences. Not to mention all the hype about this.","review_id":"vjDTMqEG-INarx2Ag65Bcg","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":10,"user_id":"S2tfbnjoCzMX0U0B_cTXVw","date":"2012-09-13"},{"cool":12,"text":"maybe because I had expected more.\n\nmaybe because I had heard they served tomahawk steaks\nbut then they didn't.\n\nmaybe because Bacchanal fell victim to my cognitive dissonance\nof a quality selection versus a variety of quantity.\n\nWhatever the reason maybe\nI was not impressed.\n\nThat's to say it wasn't good,\nBacchanal is a very good buffet.\n\nThe layout of the seating is\nquite comfortable\nand cozy when\nconsidering the size of the place.\n\nThe steamed king crab legs were hella tasty\n(and even better with a little clarified butter).\n\nLamb chops were also superb.\n\nAnd overall, the quality of the food\nwas nothing less than you \nwould expect from Caesars.\n\nAnd if you are planning on having\nonly one buffet on your Vegas excursion,\nthis would be a fine choice.\n\nThe problem this yelper\nhas with Bacchanal is this:\nI, for sure, know a couple\nother buffet places where I could\nhave gotten the same quality and selection\nfor less.\n\nAnd there the rub.\n\nWhere are these place you may ask?\n\nCheck out my Vegas list on Yelp\n(which I'm continually compiling and updating\nas we speak)\nor look for upcoming link\nto my blog eatery.","review_id":"qRLMlulxOHNhQXfHyQTkoQ","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":11,"useful":12,"user_id":"vRjVhl3ONG2GfWY4NXJZbQ","date":"2014-02-24"},{"cool":0,"text":"Let's just say I am not a super buffet fanatic.

The hot sweet potato puffs in individual baskets, lamb chops, smoked brisket, corn and lobster bisque, Kobe beef sliders, and shrimp with grits were among my favorites, not to mention the exceptional dessert selection that topped off  a (ahem) bacchanalian feast, straining the elastic waist on the pants I thoughtfully donned for the occasion.\n\nThere was so much more that I didn't get to try.  Who in their right mind could partake of all 500+ items and still live to write about it?  I'm not normally a huge eater, so this selection boggled my mind.  \n\nI didn't like some of the things I tried, such as the Chile Verde, which I normally love; here it was too spicy, the pork was way too fatty, and the sauce tasted bitter.  There was a Mexican concoction that one of our friends was eating, but when I went to get some for myself, it had been replaced by something else.  Oh well, I think I managed to stuff my face pretty well without it.\n\nI'm not crazy about the cold stainless steel ambience, which to me is completely devoid of charm.  I also was impatient with the long line at the seafood section, which was held up by the people waiting for their crab legs to be steamed.  By the time I realized I could cut the line to take the couple of shrimp I was waiting to get, I had already eaten too many of the sweet potato puffs from the basket I grabbed at the beginning of the line.\n\nOur waiter was the most attentive and helpful of any buffet we've ever eaten at, as was the hostess, who explained the setup and told us about the \"other\" side of the buffet, which we easily could have missed, since we were seated near the desserts.\n\nI can't say this is my favorite buffet in Vegas, but it definitely is worth the price of admission, especially if you have a big appetite.","review_id":"4ajLQQEmL_ASZqxpNUn1zQ","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q","date":"2012-12-28"},{"cool":0,"text":"Unbelievable!!!

I have been here three times total, twice for dinner (including opening day) and more recently for lunch.  First off I would say spend the extra money and go for dinner. It is well worth it. I was looking forward to the split king crab legs but alas they are not offered for lunch. Also, not offered for lunch is the made to order souffles in the dessert area or the hand rolls in the sushi area. Other than that relatively similar lunch and dinner items are served. \n\nThe highlights to me are the meat carving station, the prime rib is exceptionally good for being at a buffet. The charcuterie area where there are house made salamis and other cured meats to tickle your fancy. The dim sum area - where they offer a decent variety of dim sum and Peking duck. The sea food area, where I indulge on oyster shooters, crab (at dinner), and more oysters. I also enjoyed the fresh squeezed juices, I do not think this was offered at dinner, the selection included Pineapple, Jicama, and Melon. And of course let's not forget the dessert section - where without my much awaited souffles I was forced to eat key lime tarts, Oreo mousse domes and sour cherry and balsamic gelato. \n\nSo yes, I LOVE the Bacchanal. Despite my lunch let down. And this says a lot from me because in general I dislike buffets, in fact there are no other buffets I actually like in town (not including Indian lunch buffets). There are ones I will go to for the price and just have salad bar but for me to say that a buffet is great it takes a lot.

I didn't have a BAD time.  The food was alright.  Was it $56+tax a piece alright though?  No.  No, it wasn't.  I'd have been happier over at Gordon Ramsay pub.  \nI've decided, however to rate the buffet at a 3 star rating, because while I have experienced better...as far as buffets go, this was one of the best.  \n\nLets talk about getting into the place:\n\nThey have several different lines, and seemed to be pretty organized about getting a huge number of people in as quick as possible.  We had a party of 6, and so we waited off to the side with the large parties.  Sadly, we did have to wait for an hour (one of our party's fault NOT Bacchanal's)...but once all of our party arrived and paid, they got us in within 10 minutes.  \n\nService was a little on the slow side, when it came to keeping up with removing the empty/used plates at the table, but it really is a HUGE place, so not horribly disappointed in that.  \n\nThe selection is amazing.  \nAsian, stinky cheeses, slices of salami and other cured meats.  Lamb chops, ribs, sliders, mac n cheese, pizza, pasta, and seafood...not to mention the ISLAND of desserts.  \n\nThe food I tried, in as close to the order it was eaten as possible:\nveggie spring rolls: standard spring rolls.  Decent.\nShrimp and port potstickers: Really tasty.\nSalad:  Good, but where are the toppings?  I saw no croutons, veggies, etc: just lettuce and dressing.\nStinky cheeses: The bleu Stilton was my favorite, then the Camembert.  the others were good too.  \nThe Cured meats were nice, but I get the same things from my grocery store.\nRavioli Florentine:  nice.  One piece of pasta in a little personal \"pan\".  Good size, good seasoning, good flavor. \nScallop with some kind of sauce:  Meh.  Scallop was over cooked.  Didn't like the sauce at all.\nCrab legs: good, but I make them better at home, $7.99 a pound and steamed.  I really don't like when buffets split the legs.  I can get the meat out much faster and easier if you DON'T split it first.  \nShrimp: Perfectly cooked.  Good cocktail sauce too.\nMac n Cheese: Inconsistent.  First helping was amazing, and comparable to Gordon Ramsay's Truffle mac.  Second helping was mushy and NOT flavorful at all. \nLamb Chop:  Good. I prefer my lamb more mid-rare, and this was more medium well, but I felt it was seasoned pretty well.  \nBloody Mary Oyster shooters: my favorite item of the night...kinda sad isn't it?  But the oyster was tender, and the bloody mary mix was spectacularly spicy and delicious.  I had 3 of these. \nTaro Bao Bun: Nice.  Sweet.  Not out of this world though.\nchow mein: Meh.  My local Chinese take out place is better.\n\nThe desserts....I'll be honest, I don't remember everything I tried, because I took a good sampling of a good number of items.  \nTiramisu cup:  pretty good. \nBlood Orange Creme Puff: Meh.  Dry.  \nThai Tea Boba Float: this was good...for a buffet to have good boba...I was impressed.\nCherry Cheesecake pop: not good.\nmacaroons: The green one (pistachio?) and the chocolate were the best.  Good consistency.  Very light. \nMy fella got some kind of chocolate creme filled chocolate cake amazingness, which was the BEST dessert.  I wish I remembered what it was...really good.\nCreme Brulee:  decent.  \nRed velvet brownie:  decent. \nPana cotta: disgusting.  \n\nSo...all in all...not a mind blowing experience, but better than the other buffets in town (that I've tried.)\n\nWould I go back? No.  Its not worth the money, not by any stretch of the imagination.  I'd rather take my $123 dollars, go to Gordon Ramsay, and have a nice pub meal and a beer or two.  \n\nWould I recommend it?  It depends.  If you REALLY have your heart set on trying a Las Vegas Buffet, and have the $56 per person to spend...sure.  Go.  The food is good.  I just don't think its $56 good. \n\n**Oh, and also, apparently for $15 extra, you can add all you can drink wine or beer.  They did NOT tell us this when we paid.**  ( I wouldn't advise that though...filling up on liquid instead of food....)","review_id":"aV8LnuxLctq90-dozlM7Sg","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":5,"useful":6,"user_id":"renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A","date":"2016-02-15"},{"cool":0,"text":"Not as great as I thought it would be.

I don't know if there really is 500 items and I don't plan to count them anytime soon... but this buffet does have a HUGE selection! And seriously, like everything I tried was good!\n\nI've been here several times and it's hard to say if this buffet is better than Wicked Spoon. I think they are pretty much head to head and I guess it would come down to personal preference as to which place has more foods you like to eat. I've been to both buffets several times and even I can't decide which I like better! As far as the Studio B buffet at the M hotel that is also raved about, I think that buffet is nowhere to compare to Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon. I've tried Studio B buffet - I didn't like it much... \n\nAnyways, this buffet feels very open, airy, and the lighting is good. When you enter, cold seafoods are to your right, followed by American food, hot meats, Mexican food... follow the corner and you will hit the Italian, salads, and Asian food sections. You can order and customize tacos, pasta, and Asian noodles. They even have honeycombs here! The desserts here are also very good and I always take a gelato cone to-go!\n\nAs far as prices, this buffet is the MOST expensive of them all!! Dinner is a staggering $51 and lunch is $32. If you have a total rewards card, it will take $1 off the price and give you some tier credits as well. I've never experienced a line here, but from what I read, the line can be horrendous... maybe I've just always gone at the perfect time! During breakfast/lunch, they have fresh squeezed juices which taste amazingly fresh! The only difference I've noticed between lunch and dinner were the cold seafood... since I'm not a fan of cold seafood, it's not worth paying an extra $20 to me. If I wanted to gorge on purely seafood, I would just go to the Village Seafood Buffet at Rio which is $45 because they have HOT seafood, including all the lobster tails you can stomach. Service here is good and they clean your tables fairly quickly. \n\nNOTE: This buffet is NOT included in the Buffet of Buffet passes. Breakfast is extra $15, Lunch is extra $20, and Dinner is extra $25. I've done the buffet of buffet pass before and I don't think it's worth it to use it here and pay the surcharge. Just use the buffet of buffet passes to it's full value at the other buffets and come here to eat another day. \n\nI think this buffet is definitely worth the try! I've gotten many people to fall in love with this buffet after trying it. I think by a small margin, I would say that this buffet wins when it comes to the Bacchanal vs Wicked Spoon buffet. It's like saying one got an A++ and the other an A+. Both are spectacular buffets. Wicked Spoon is however the original master of this new way of buffet - high end foods in small portions. If price is more important, than go with Wicked Spoon, dinner there is about $40.  I think that I would say that Bacchanal wins barely because they have a larger selection and a slightly more upscale feeling. They also have candy in candy jars!

I met an out-of-town friend for lunch at the buffet yesterday.  We met at 12:15 and only waited about 15 minutes in line.  Once inside, we didn't have to wait longer than 3 people for anything, so we were very surprised how convenient the lunchtime buffet was.  Other reviews indicate that dinner is a different story - so I recommend going for lunch!  No, you won't get crab legs at lunch, but if that isn't important to you, then go for lunch!  I don't think anyone can eat everything here, so I will only speak to the things we ate.  The lunch buffet with tax was $32.  Honestly, most people will probably spend $20 to $30 on lunch anywhere on the Strip, so it's not an entirely bad deal.  The service was excellent and our drinks never went below half empty.  Here's my food comments.  Things I loved: the sushi was surprisingly good though the soy sauce had too much sodium.  The cooked meats were killer good - including the brisket and ribs, cut to order.  Excellent sweet cornbread.  The shrimp on ice and seafood paella was good.  The mac-n-cheese was not your standard mac-n-cheese and really awesome!  The tacos are made to order - you just tell them the meat and he grills it up and makes it for you.  NOW FOR THE DESSERT.  SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!  The bread pudding was excellent - espcially with a hot cup of coffee after lunch!  \n\nIt says there is a 2-hour maximum.  We stayed longer and nobody said anything.  But it also wasn't very busy and we were just chatting mostly - and not consuming ravenous amounts of food.  As we were leaving at 3:15pm, we noticed that the crab legs were being served.  Again, not my thing - but if they come out for \"dinner\" at 3:00pm, you might be wise to eat around 3-4pm to avoid long lines.  \n\nI will definitely return for the lunch buffet.  Probably not for the dinner buffet - because I can't eat $50 worth of food.  It's a very good buffet experience that you should try at least once!","review_id":"How2r58-3i2IapZn9v0RqA","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":3,"user_id":"JnN7fWESKk3MXR2zfD_XKw","date":"2012-12-22"},{"cool":0,"text":"We went for breakfast on a Tuesday morning.

The wait in line was not bad at all.\n\nThe food was beautifully displayed with fresh juices in mini carafes when you first walk in for breakfast.  They had orange, melon, carrot, cucumber, tropical, tomato, grapefruit, etc.\n\nThere were Red Velvet Pancakes on a giant rotating griddle.  Later there were tortillas on it.\n\nThere was a carving station with sausages, Salmon Wellington, and meats.  One sausage was very spicy!  The Salmon Wellington was very flaky and good with the dill sauce on the side.\n\nThe individual egg dishes were cute, but luke warm and dried out.  The tater tots, onion rings, and waffle fries were in mini frying baskets.  They were sitting under warmers.  I like my fries hot and freshly fried.\n\nThe Xiao Long Bao was deflated, dried out, and had very little soup inside.  But it was so cute in the mini bamboo basket.  The broccoli in the Broccoli Beef was over cooked.  The Shrimp Fried Rice was hard, but the shrimp were tender.  The Lotus Wrapped Sticky Rice had a generous portion of filling inside.\n\nThe breakfast desserts mainly consisted on croissants and danishes.  There was a vanilla pudding in a shotglass with assorted berries.  I ate 4 of them.  My friend had the Crepe made-to order with fresh whipped cream and berries.

It is luxurious, expansive, and gluttonous. This past trip with Fanny H., we made it a thing to spend a couple of hours here eating and relaxing after two nights of hard partying in Sin City.\n\nThis most recent time- there were a couple of misses, but overall still a fantastic buffet option.\n\nThe weekend seafood brunch was $54 with tax. We unintentionally entered around 14:00 so we ended up enjoying the fancier dinner items that came out around 16:00.\n\nBest piece of advice: get down to Caesars early and reserve a spot to wait in line. It can be very busy during peak times, and waits can last as much as 90 minutes. You have to wait to get in line, then wait to pay and be seated. If you have a party of six or more, you'll have to  wait in a separate line. They also snap a photo before you enter, so tell your hungover friends (i.e. me) to smile and not look too much like a hot mess.\n\nHighlights: Prime Rib and Lamb continue to be amazing. Sashimi salad was amazing, and the endless amounts of crab legs.\nMeh: Not feeling the laksa, though I appreciate the effort in even making this available.\n\nUnfortunately, service wasn't the greatest this time around. We had to hunt for our first server and we had plated and plates piled on our table that made it difficult to eat. We knew it was busy during brunch, but there were points where we would simply not see our server when we really needed assistance.\n\nBacchanal is still a legit buffet- definite Top 3 in my Vegas book.

When I tried to go to dinner around 5pm Christmas Eve, the system told me the wait was approximately 420 minutes... about SEVEN HOURS. In fact, it told me to check back with the hosts noon the next day. Realizing that I would not be eating there that night, I left. I came back around 8:30am on the 26th, and there was no line for the holiday brunch.\n\nI think I prefer the dinner menu over the brunch menu, and it's worth the extra money. The dinner comes with oysters, which were very high-quality for a buffet. The carving station has more meats available. And the desserts for dinner are 100 times better.\n\nBoth the brunch and dinner had crab legs.

OK, forget the crab legs, I saw fried chicken which comes in its own little fryer with fries, pretty good..........but salty as well, fuck I seriously think buffets just pound a bunch of salt.

I showed my Total Rewards card and was surprised that even after discount dinner was $50 pp.  \n\nAfter we paid we were escorted to our seats, and I admired how nice the decor was.  Unfortunately I wasn't that hungry so I didn't enjoy too much of this 500 item buffet, but we were all impressed with the meat carving station, the dessert station, and the seafood assortment to name a few.  Just like Wicked Spoon, they serve a lot of items in those cute little fryers and individual plates.  They also supply you with upon paying (and have them at the stations too) little rubber grabbers for hot plates.\n\nMy top picks were the: hot crab legs (the guy working the station gave me so many), the pizza special of the day, the poke, siu mai, prime rib & smoked ribs.\n\nWanted to love, but thought it was so so: Sweet potato tots, waygu slider (a little on the dry side), fried chicken (should have not gotten the breast) served with sweet potato fries), kalbi, sushi, broccoli & cheese.\n\nSkip: Fried rice, shrimp and chive dumpling.\n\nDessert picks: chocolate covered strawberries, the different flavors of mochi ice creams. chocolate oreo peanut butter ganache cake thing, dessert cup with chocolate and passion fruit.\n\nDessert skips: My friends loved the macaroons but I didn't care for them.

Is it better than my favorite, Wicked Spoon?  I'd say quality wise, yes, tastewise, I did have more of an appetite at WS, so that could have played a factor as well.  The food is still delicious at both buffets.  But I've also eaten more items and twice at Wicked Spoon (solely for Mimosa brunch).

The lamb chops were wayyyy overcooked. The butter station was constantly empty and they give you little ghetto plastic cups for your butter. I went on a wild goose chase to find horseradish for my prime rib. ONE person running the meat station, as opposed to Bellagio Buffet where they have a separate person for each cut of meat. The shrimp had a really stinky smell and I kept getting little slivers of shell in my crab meat. Just no. \n\nHonestly, the highlight of my meal was the gelato station.

This is where they almost hid the Italian, Asian and cheese plate selections. I couldn't believe how many different foods they offer.

But I think it is so worth it. I personally hate waiting to eat so I usually always go to the kiosk first like in the early morning and get my ticket to eat dinner later time. It's usually 4 hour wait when Vegas is busy.\n\nBut let me tell you, even after you get your ticket, you have to wait for the text message saying 'your table is almost ready and you can come pay first'. It almost sounds like you can get in right away and dine in right? Well, no. You have to wait another hour or more depending on the volume of people. It's so horrible. But that is why I go in and stay there and try every single food possible.\n\nI have my few favorites from here. First would be their crab legs. I prefer to eat the warm ones from Italian section than the cold ones from the Seafood section. But then again, I saw them cooking and they literally take the cold ones and put them in the pot full of water and you get your crab legs later when it's warm enough to serve. I wish they can actually steam them on a steamer instead of 'boiling' them in the water becauae while its boiling, it loses all the flavor. But it was good enough for me to taste the crab so I liked it.\n\nSecons favorite would be lamb chop or rack of lamb. I dont know if they have this regularly because last time I went, they didnt have any. But they had it on my most recent visit. They are so tender and juicy. I am definitely not a fan of lamb but this would probably be the only lamb I would eat. I dont know how many racks I had but I had so much.\n\nMy other favorite would be the udon noodles from the Asian section. I really like the broth here and a couple bean curds they put in. It's pretty strong in flavor, the bean curd, but its good as its moistened in the broth. It was an unusual find to like the noodles here.\n\nJuices in the cute glass bottles are definitely a must try. I really like the two flavors the most. Pineapple and Horchata. These two were so good that I made my friends try it too. It's refreshing. Sometimes they would have none out, and you can ask the guy working inside the kitchen for the flavor you want. They will hand it to you if they have it.\n\nLast but not least their pistachio souffle and pistachio macarons are great to try from the dessert section. For pistachio souffle, you have to order them because it is not out most of the time. They will tell you to come back in 10 minutes or so. It's pretty good. Do I need to say anything about macarons? Their green pistachio macarons are so good. Macarons from Le Village Buffet is horrible. You wont be disappointed. However, they might not have it depending on when you visit the buffet.\n\nI still think Bacchanal buffet is far better than  The Buffet at Wynn. A small tip for you would be to go in around 2 PM before 3 PM to pay Lunch price and enjoy dinner menus. But you have to be lucky because you dont know how long it would take to get to the front of the line to pay for it.","review_id":"uzMNAOqumAsFdP7ZHr4E6w","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":2,"useful":6,"user_id":"_VD870pQZJPqcGd07vxMsg","date":"2015-01-16"},{"cool":1,"text":"Wow...

The most impressive station in the buffet would have to be the desserts. I absolutely loved the mochi ice cream and gelato. The quality of all the food is pretty decent but I would never wait in such a long time or pay that price for buffet again. If you want to try Bacchanal, the best time is probably brunch or late lunch to avoid lines and you pay a discounted price. AVOID going during holidays, they mark up the price and there's really nothing special on the menu to justify that price change.","review_id":"Qod8B8oMLByRydBzqKWKfw","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":4,"useful":7,"user_id":"AOsb45lNP7AzQwwWLUQxEg","date":"2013-07-08"},{"cool":1,"text":"Vegas truly offers some of the most extravagant buffet in the world.\n\nWe came here for Saturday brunch ($44.99 + tax - $1 discount with Total Rewards card). Unlike other Vegas buffets where you stand and wait in line, you first walk up to one of the kiosk machines and input your name, phone number, and party size. Once Bacchanal has an available spot for your party, you will receive a text and ask you to check-in and pay at the cashier within 15 minutes. The estimated waiting was supposedly 70 minutes, but we only waited for 30 minutes. \n\nHonestly, this whole place did feel like a mini food heaven. You can find dim sum in the Chinese section, prime rib in the meat section, pre-cut crab legs in seafood section, a juice bar with freshly made fruit / vegetable juices, and many more. \n\nPlate 1: BBQ pork, roasted duck, sushi, sashimi, dim sum (har gow, shumai), beef chow fun: For a buffet, all Chinese and Japanese food tasted pretty much hit the spot. Just don't expect these food to be five-star quality.\n\nPlate 2: Fried chicken, smoked brisket, bone-in prime rib, sweet potato tots, Wagyu beef sliders: I thought sweet potato tots was pretty unique and Wagyu beef sliders was definitely a highlight. Unfortunately, prime rib and fried chicken were average at best. The prime rib at Wynn Buffet tasted so much better. \n\nPlate 3: mussels, oysters, crab legs, chef special (mushroom polenta), sauteed mushrooms: Pre-sliced FRESH crab legs? Fresh mussels and oysters? This must be a seafood heaven! \n\nPlate 4: creme brulee, egg tart, almond cookie, green tea cookie with azuki beans, pecan sticky buns: Other than pecan sticky buns, everything else tasted amazing. That creme brulee ... I can eat that thing 3 times a day. \n\nGelato (Thai tea + red bean flavors) and horchata: One of the best gelato I've had, but it melt so quickly =(. Oh and horchata is a must try - sooooo good. \n\nMain takeaway: Wynn Buffet has better prime ribs and Bacchanal Buffet has better desserts (and horchata). Not a perfect buffet, but you definitely get what you pay for.","review_id":"Uo9vryESuTrVFG2s6VK0vw","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":3,"user_id":"rQLEfpfSjVK-3dBmIMKZDA","date":"2014-05-19"},{"cool":16,"text":"Wow!\n\nBest buffet I have ever had the \"button popping\" pleasure of experiencing! Living in Vegas, land of the buffet, I have certainly seen my share of buffets. \n\nMy biggest regret here is that I ran out of stomach for all the tasty items that were available! They have over 500 options for you at any given point in time! I tried to keep the portions small, so I could taste as many different things as possible, but after 3 plates,an awesome dish of Rigatoni, and some deserts, I had to throw in the towel.\n\nEverybody seemed to be mobbing the Seafood and Meat stations, so I started out with some Asian and Italian. The peppered beef was so tender and juicy and the orange chicken so full of flavor! Chicken skewers were second only to a friends Mom who makes  it homemade. That being said, they were great! The Peking Duck was pretty tasty as well! \n\nThey had these sliders there that were rdeiculously good, and much meatier than I first thought! I wanted more of those, but had to try as many different things as I could. A must for my next trip here(which will happen soon!) You could tell presentation is a high priority  for the buffet as well, making it feel more like an experience and not just like \"just another buffet\".\n\nDuring one of my trips to stock up on more food, I was at the Italian \"station\" and commented to my friend that the little deep dish rigatonis looked good, but it appeared as though it may have been there for a few minutes. Just as quickly as the last word slipped out of my mouth I see a hand pull that dish back and a second later a fresh staeming one slid right back in its place! lol Oh hell yea! Now THAT is service aimed at guest satisfaction!\n\nThe deserts were incredible as well! I hate to sound redundant, but this place is truly impressive. They had a selection of unique and exotic ice cream flavors, including Strawberry cheesecake. I enjoyed Watermelon Mint, and it was mighty tasty! \n\nTable service was great as well, Whenever I got up and left the table for another trip to the buffet, I always returned to a clean table with dirty plates gone and drinks refilled! There was a little issue where my drink was ordered twice and forgotten, but considering everything else, and how packed the place was, I can certainly be understanding.\n\nAll in all, a great experience and when I have friends and family in town(which is quite frequently) I will use that as an excuse to come back here and try all those things I didn't have room for on this occasion.\n\n5 stars and a double rainbow all the way!","review_id":"7rpHp_nd3VidIRVf6pJXaA","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":13,"useful":18,"user_id":"CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog","date":"2012-09-20"},{"cool":1,"text":"The hordes of people at the entrance kind of scared me (crowds!), but I understand that they had just opened so it was to be expected. I went here as part of the Elite Grand Opening event (thank you Yelp & Caesars!).\n\nNear the entrance is the seafood area. There were a number of hot prepared seafood-y items, like clams and mussels in a bucket, shrimp & grits, halibut / salmon, paella.. My friend asked one of the guys back there if any of them were gluten-free. I'm not sure if it was because he was busy / first week jitters, but he seemed inconvenienced. Anyways, he said the fish and mussels were safe. After the hot items, you got the cold seafood items. Piles of shrimp and crab legs. On my first pass, the shrimp looked a bit dried out and grey. After taking a look at it a second time, I saw that they had changed it out and the shrimp was much pinker and plump. The crab legs was what I was in line for. They can heat them up for you, and it does seem to taste better that way.\n\nAfter seafood, I went to the salad and charcuterie area. I liked their variety of meats, but was a bit miffed to see Tillamook cheddar on there. I like Tillamook cheese, but it's something I can get at the grocery store. I will give them points for labeling the cheeses. The honey \"station\" was probably the best part though. They had fresh honeycomb, which people could take a chunk out, while the honey dripped down into pots with star anise, cinnamon in them so that it would infuse the honey.\n\nNext up I went to their comfort food and meats area. Mac n cheese, scalloped taters.. Yum yum! I saw that they had prime rib there, but wanted to save room for dessert I opted for the lamb chops. They only give you one chop, so I asked for a couple more hehe. :) It was nicely medium-rare, and went very well with the scalloped taters.\n\nThere were a lot of things that I wanted to try, but I don't like to waste and I was getting kind of full by this point. So I went off to the dessert area. I didn't see any standalone fruit. I don't think I saw any in the salad area as well. You know, the freshly cut melons and oranges that seem standard in a buffet. Maybe I wasn't looking hard enough? *shrug* Anyways, they have a great selection of small treats. There was this passionfruit (I think) creme cake that was utterly divine. Light, smooth and not overly sweet. My friend got one of the custards, he said the attendant told him it was gluten free but when I tasted it, it seemed like there was a cake layer on the bottom. Either that, or it was gritty.\n\nOur server at the table was very nice and helpful. She came by a couple times to check on our drinks. Other servers cleared our plates efficiently. They offered coffee as things were winding down, which was unexpected. I'm not sure if this is part of regular service or if it was because we were there for the event.\n\nOverall, I would say this will give other buffets in town a run for the money. The assistant exec chef said that they are still in the learning process, so things may change.\n\nAs I walked out, I looked at some of the tables to see what they were eating. Maannn, they had PHO and RAMEN??","review_id":"ovj3B9rNTxC-5bBe4YEMJQ","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"GYz2-BBolFD5h_D6S5gi3w","date":"2012-10-01"},{"cool":14,"text":"as most of you may know, i go back home (to vegas) every month, sometimes 2x.  we mostly come here for sunday or saturday brunch/dinner. of the 7 times we've been here, we've only been disappointed once.\n\nfriends have told me the wait can be from 20 minutes to 2 hours. i'm not sure because i don't stand in that long line. there's a separate line for me, so i don't wait and i get seated right away!  those are the perks for gambling for total rewards. \n\nservice is excellent. mimosas are always refilled and sometimes, the server will make it stronger for me. yay! plates are always taken away at a timely manner, water's constantly refilled, etc. no issues here.\n\ni've found that the chinese, mexican and the italian sections are always consistent. carving station's a hit or miss.  their brisket and prime rib meats are yummy. seafood section - crab legs are just ok here (you can get them steamed). ceviche is good, though. \n\ntheir chicken and waffles were tasteless and dry, croque madame was nasty (i suggest you eat the real thing at Hatfield's), and sushi is no good.\n\nfavorites: chinese chow mein (i know, i know... but it's so good!!), miso soup, youtiao + rice congee, tacos, dimsum, mango juice, tater tots, and truffle potato gratin!\n\nnot a huge fan of their desserts... but i loooooooove their yummy donuts!!!

You truly get what you pay for. $98 for dinner for two is a bit steep but the service was amazing.\n\nThe food was a hit or a miss. The Asian section served up what you can find at your local panda express. The food seemed bland and tasteless. The pizza had quite a bit of choices in regards to what slice caught your attention. The seafood was good but the sea bass was a bit fishy. I got to try the fried chicken and waffles. The waffle fries were a bit greasy but still tasty. The chicken was crispy but dry on the inside. The heat-lamp I'm assuming is to blame for that. The cuts of meat had a nice selection. The lamb was delicious and the jelly mint was perfect. The prime rib was overcooked. I like my prime rib a bit bloody ready to walk off the place but that's just my preference.\n\nThe desert section had quite a bit of options. I was disappointed that the ice cream selection wasn't more classic. No cookies and cream? Seriously. They do have homemade marsh-mellows and they are pretty damn good. The cake pops are my favorite! Also two types of creme brulee? Sign me up!!! \n\nMy drink glass never went empty.

Then my expectations are set high only to be let down when I actually go see the film. That is the case w Bacchanal. \n\nI was surprised by the 45 min from line to table when arriving at 12:30, since others claimed they waited over 2 hours. The cashier said everyone arrives around 1, wait in line and try to time it by staying for the dinner dishes starting at 3. It easily becomes a 2 hour wait before being seated. For me, it's just not worth the time wasted unless I'm sitting next to Bourdain.\n\nThe seating area is huge and cleverly partitioned by modern dividers made of wooden blocks or colored glass. The food stations were definitely not what I expected. Their claim of 500 items made me picture an endless line of different cuisines. Instead, there were a few average size stations. \n\nThe layout is not well thought out. The Asian station is placed around a corner past the end of the Mexican station. Unless people are told, it may be easy to miss the entire area. The lines for the crab legs and oysters get long quickly and cuts right into the front of the carving station, which has its own line. The dessert station, its own island in the middle of the buffet is the exception. It's visible from all sides, easy to navigate and displays some tempting sweets ( macarons, ice cream mochi & exotic flavor gelato are some items that stood out ) \n\nThe flavor of the dishes vary...\nTacos were good. But the steak tacos were too salty and oily.\nFried chicken in a basket was dry. Sweet pot fried underneath glistened w grease. \nBuffalo wings lacked that \"kick\". \nTater tots were indeed crunchy and good as many had mentioned. \nPrime rib: bloody, tender and tasty. \nBrisket was also good but get the slice w the bark and some fat for flavor. \nBlack chicken soup: fragrant, soothing and good. \nRamen: not too bad, but don't expect a real nice bowl of perfectly cooked noodles w ingredients. They just threw in 1 piece of BBQ pork. I threw it back out. \nSteamed crab legs: good but need to ask for them.\nFresh OJ, watermelon juice and mango nectar in a small glass jar. Great! Stops at 3 so load up. \nMacarons, of course good\nMochi: same stuff in stores but they had Kona Coffee, which is harder to find in LA and not cheap. \nCorn beef hash w a tiny egg: very cute dish, almost a one biter but had no corn beef, just a tiny egg over potatoes. \nFrench sandwich w a tiny egg: also tiny and cute, but I pulled out something that looks like a hair, so skipped it. \n\nThough we were told it's regular menu, we were charged holiday prices. Using the Rewards card knocked off 2 bucks so it was $45 each. Not worth it imo. But for first timers wanting to fill the curiosity, try it during regular prices, at about $28 if I recall correctly (?)\n\nBacchanal is not a place I'm anxious to return to, but may give it another shot some time in the future.","review_id":"2IbOOIy7jAxIwaRkjCKO1g","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"n8YKNoz1xJHJDe-_jxfbcQ","date":"2012-12-30"},{"cool":0,"text":"we finally got to come back here again to eat.  it's been over 3 years and it's changed a little bit as far as the quality. no longer 5 stars but 4 stars. it's still a very good buffet with the nice variety and all.  however i felt the quality overall was not as high as when we were here 3 years ago. i understand that when we went it was a very new buffet. i just hope they don't continue to decline their quality like they did at the Studio B buffet at the M Resort.","review_id":"OVm-p8YrPFZdV2oQTDCOaw","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"C6uxJzwfCS-EsGACRocTBg","date":"2016-06-14"},{"cool":1,"text":"Las Vegas is changing all the time. It's always out with the old, in with the new. It is always best to be the newest and the hottest in Vegas. You always need to reinvent yourself. Caesar's Palace is one place where thought it is an old property compared to the rest, it keeps it fresh and interesting on the inside. This change also happens to the buffets as well. You can't have endless roast beef and a mound of crab legs and say you are the best. These days, we want gourmet stuff, and a lot of it. That is why small plates of different dishes are popular at Vegas buffets. Bacchanal Buffet in Caesar's Palace is just the place. Taking Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon off its short lived rein as top dog, Bacchanal is the newest Buffet in town.\n\nComing here on a Sunday as a last hurray meal, the line was packed. Payard across the way was looking mighty tempting. No line, no wait. It is safe to say, I waited in line for everyone who reads my blog -- This is for you! The wait was nearly an hour, but it was the newest buffet in Vegas. I had to.\n\nI was glad to see a lot of variety at this buffet. They had small dishes of different things. Instead of ladling on the food from a pile of food, you just pick up the plates that look My favorites included the authentic tacos, cured meats, and crab legs. Bacchanal buffet featured many items that aren't available at a normal buffet. For this reason, the buffet was a good experience.\n\nGoing to a buffet is all about having everything you want, even dessert. You can have your cake, and eat it too. Their dessert selection was quite impressive. From cookies in a jar to macarons, and ice cream, you can have anything you want. My favorite were the crepes. I just saw the jar of Nutella and I was set. The crepes were wonderfully prepared and were a great finish to my buffet.\n\nBacchanal at Caesar's Palace is awesome. Their new approach to the buffet in Vegas is refreshing. Pretty soon, all of the top tier Vegas buffets will have to do this. One thing I did not like about the buffet is the inconsistency of the design. I prefer open spaces when eating at buffets, but theirs was a bit broken up. It was tough to navigate through the different sections. Also, the seating areas are not all the same. The outside area was wide open and bright, but there were seating areas in the corners and different rooms. Not all of the furniture (tables are chairs) was the same. This made for an uneven feeling and everything felt clustered. Other than that though, the food was great. Still though, my all time favorite buffet is still Wicked Spoon.","review_id":"pQv5TlKjr8-URL_JnbhGpg","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"m33gSTi0Fyo3W2Qw6WVdtA","date":"2014-07-29"},{"cool":1,"text":"8/10/15..breakfast is 30.99, lunch 37.99 and dinner is 50.99..

Overall this is a Buffet lovers dream! You cannot beat the value for the selection and quality of food and flavors! Best value on the strip. \n\nThis is not only a feast of feasts with the intense flavors from around the world but it has very attractive aesthetics and a rather unique design from one of the most sought after design firms in the world. It's unlike any other buffet. It's elegantly warm, modern and sophisticated. Designed to make you, the diner, interact with the Chefs who prepare your food in open show kitchens throughout each of the sections. Its incredibly thoughtful and you feel almost at home. \n\nCuisines range from East to West and everything in between. It's got an incredible seafood selection. Freshly made to order just about everything! Street style tacos, Japanese Ramen, Dessert Soufflé, freshly Steamed Crab legs etc. It's no joke. \n\nThere were a few things that missed the mark. The Paella was missing the lovely char at the bottom of the pan where the rice is crispy. It was more like rice and seafood cooked separately then placed in a cast iron skillet for presentation. If you're going to make fresh noodles for Ramen than at least do the Paella justice and cook it traditionally, all in one pan. \n\nThe Pho was a little under seasoned. It was spot on for taste profile but lacking salt. Nothing more boring than bland soup. \n\nThe Pork Ramen stole the show in my opinion. It was perfect. It was incredibly delicious. Perfectly seasoned with all the tender flavors of the pork. Freshly made noodles are cooked to order in front of you. \n\nI was a little disappointed that they did not have their long list of made to order Soufflés, instead only serving one tonight. Like a phantom pain, I will miss it.

At 5:30pm there was already a long line.  Since I don't gamble, I don't have a rewards card so we had to stand in line for 30 minutes which allowed us to chat while waiting.  I paid $54.04 per person and I think it was worth the money.\n\nAs soon as you get in, you're greeted by seafood: crab legs, oysters, clams, mussels, shrimps, etc.  Since I'm allergic to that stuff, I didn't bother trying it (one allergic reaction per week is my quota). Then you pass through the American station (sliders, ribs, BBQ, rib eye, sausage, onion rings, prime rib, tater tots, corn on the cob, truffle potatoes, sweet potato fries, etc), Mexican station (salsa, tortilla, etc) and dessert station (macarons, gelato, cakes, cupcakes, tarts, fruits, cake pops, creme brûlée, bread pudding, crepes, etc) in the middle. The charcuterie (mortadella, coppa, salami, prosciutto, mocecta and air-dried sausages),  and cheese stations plus Italian (pizza, ziti, stromboli, etc) and Asian (sushi, pho, ramen; salty and spicy fish, bao, shumai, hargao, dumplings and other Chinese dishes) stations are in the back.\n\nI was so excited about the pho and ramen.  I ordered a bowl of pho and I asked the two chefs \"where's the noodles?\" and they kept pointing at it and I was like \"all I see is broth?\" so I gave them back my bowl and shamelessly asked for more - much better.  If I were on a diet, I wouldn't be at a buffet.  Also, try the salty and spicy fish.\n\nLet's talk about desserts...they have mini vanilla cupcakes, mini chocolate cupcakes and mini red velvet cupcakes (with extra tart cream cheese frosting), chocolate brownie tart (skip the tart and just eat the chocolate brownie on top), cake pops and tiramisu were nothing to write home about.  The chocolate and passion fruit dessert was not good.  I give them A for effort on the macarons.  They're not fantastic.  In fact, the pistachio, orange and rose all tasted so artificial and only the vanilla and chocolate macarons were good.  They're hard to make though.  The desserts I did enjoy were chocolate creme brûlée, fig & balsamic gelato, baklava gelato and Aztec chocolate gelato.\n\nNow the best buffets in Vegas in my opinion include: Wynn, Bellagio, Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan and Studio B at M (my favorite).  For having pho, ramen, unusual gelati, macarons, charcuterie, salty and spicy fish (YUM!!!), crepes and juicy sliders - Bacchanal deserves 5 stars.  The quality of fish they use for their sushi isn't as fresh as Studio B's.  Just imagine this, if Wicked Spoon (single serving plating) and Studio B (delicious variety) had a buffet baby...Bacchanal would've been it.","review_id":"2Xc1AIEFFQTaCgMEZSd9ig","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":4,"useful":6,"user_id":"tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg","date":"2012-09-29"},{"cool":0,"text":"My first mistake was trying to eat here on Memorial day weekend.

Looks like Caesar's Palace really beefed up their game in the buffet competition. It isn't hard to see that they 'borrowed ' a lot of ideas from the popular Wicked Spoon. Most of the food is individually portioned and even give you these cute little rubber grip to hold the hot plates. Their raw seafood bar is the most impressive of all (among Ballagio, Wynn and Wicked Spoon). They exceeded in both variety and quality. It is not often you can find some decent crawfish cooked in Cajun seasonings. Raw oysters were fresh and sweet.\n\nBacchanal buffet have a lot to offer. You can find simple American fare, the usual meat craving station, as well as Mediterranean, Asian, Italian and whole bunch of International cuisine. Of course, they have a sinfully beautiful dessert station as well.\n\nI enjoyed my meal. I think the quality is better than the Wicked Spoon and Wynn.

The lay out is a little strange because initially I thought to my self what is the hype about, I do not see very much.  The buffet is laid out sort of in a Z fashion with it wrapping around the corner.  As first I did not notice it until I saw a number of people walking out from around a corner.

I've heard it from friends, seen Yelp reviews, read stories about it on foodie websites, but never experienced it myself. I figured it was time, so I took myself here on a Sunday morning at 9 AM to partake of the brunch offering.\n\nThe steep price of $54 hit me in the face after I sailed through a non-existent line (come early, you will avoid the hung-over tourists). But I willingly paid my bill with hope still in my heart that it would be worth it. Please, please be worth it.\n\nI was seated at a small table, perfect for my one person party and told I could begin, and my waitress would be back to get my drink order. \n\nThe place does have a large, selection, I'm not going to say it doesn't - it does. They also do a mix of small personal plates, with normal buffet offerings you spoon onto your plate, which by the way can make things kind of weird, especially since the plates aren't all that big.\n\nFirst I went for the seafood - crab claws, crab legs, raw shrimp, a lobster Benedict (personal small portion). This is where things get weird, I wanted the lobster Benedict, and I would have happily just grabbed the tiny dish and made my way, but it was too damn hot, and the little plastic grabby things they offer DO NOT WORK very well. So I had to cram the tiny square plate onto my normal sized plate which was already full of raw seafood.\n\nA listing of what I (can remember) I had and impressions:\n\nRaw Crab/Shrimp - great, can't really complain there.\n\nLobster Benedict - Also good, creamy, and plenty of lobster\n\nRed Velvet Pancakes - Terrible, dry, and not enough syrup. Stacked three high and yet who wants to eat the other two even drier pancakes under the first one?\n\nMini Donuts w/ Bananas Foster - Very skimpy on the bananas foster, also the donuts were dry, just like the pancakes. \n\nChilaquelas - Much better dish, very good, I should have gotten two. Good flavor pairings. \n\nMachacha - I'm not even sure what this was, but it was again, FREAKIN DRY. It looked good, then you dig in and.... ddrrryyy.\n\nScrambled eggs, hash-browns, and mushrooms - All very good, and did not come as tiny plated versions, I dug them out of a large heaps like a regular \n'ol buffet style. The mushrooms to note were one of my favorites of the whole buffet. \n\nChicken/Waffle/Fry THING - So, so cute, but such a disappointment. It comes in an ice cream waffle cone, and I was like, I'm not eating this. Okay the little chicken wing that was in there was OK. I would have rather just had a bunch of those chicken wings, but I guess it would look kind of weird for me to dig them out of all the waffle cones eh?\n\nMixed fruit parfait - Heavenly! Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed a yogurt cup with mixed fruit. \n\nPorky Belly w/ mashed taters - Very good, salty, fatty. Everything pork belly should be.\n\nOf note, but I did not partake of: the meat carving station looked amazing, but I had no hankering for meats during my visit. An omelet making station, I did not want to partake because I thought it would fill me up too much and I wouldn't have room for other food. A bar for making lox - looked good, did not try. A decent Asian section of food. A small salad bar. Quite a few decent looking pizzas. \n\nOddly disappointing: \n\nMeager sushi selection - they had out spam musubi and one other roll. Maybe they have the better selections outside of brunch.\n\nDesserts - Totally comparable to smaller, less expensive buffets, with the exception of the make your own crepe and gelato bar.\n\nBut also pleasing - service was great, especially for a buffet. My server really took care of me, which I really appreciated. Whenever I got up and came back my dirty plate was gone and my water was refilled. She also kept me stocked on decaf coffee and creamer. \n\nWould I go back?

I usually try little portions of different foods like tacos, Asian noodles, cold dishes (e.g. shrimp, crab legs, and salads), and meats. Tacos were way too salty, literally tasted like it was prepared with ounces of salt. The Asian noodles, specifically the Pho, were not cooked properly (under cooked).

We arrived around 5:45 pm and waited in a short line. \n\nAfter it was our turn to enter the buffet and be seated, the seating hostess showed gave us a brief tour of the food and selections (she had asked if it was our 1st visit). My initial thought of this place was that the selection is smaller than other buffets on the strip. I would say that this buffet is more so focused on quality over quantity. I was impressed with the Chinese section, as the food was quite authentic. I was definitely a fan of the roasted duck and dim sum offerings. The employees and chef in this section were quiet friendly as I spoke with them while I was browsing the area. \n\nI also enjoyed the Italian/ French section with the chicken confit and polenta. You can really taste the flavors in each bite. I liked that these fancy tasty items were served in small little serving dishes. \n\nI also enjoyed the lamb at the carving station and also the seafood section (which is what I am guessing they are known for... especially with the long line forming). Offerings that I enjoyed included stone crab (very few buffets offer this type of crab, which happens to be my husband's favorite type of crab), oysters and crab legs. There are also mussels, ceviche and pureed smoked salmon and such available as well. \n\nI thought the dessert section was nice, but again did not have as many choices as other buffets. But the taste and quality of the desserts were quite good and indulgent. I was sadly disappointed to only see one macaron (an interesting flavor of red bean, white bean with black sesame seeds) offered. There was also this pistachio flavored cake that looked like a macaron that tasted nice but still sad that it wasn't an actual macaron (I thought there would be plenty of macarons here because of the photos I saw on this yelp page and also was mentioned in previous yelper reviews). \n\nThis buffet does offer things that other buffets may not necessarily offer that includes waygu sliders and truffle fries and street tacos. So I can see how this buffet is highly rated and also known as one of the best buffets on the strip. \n\nService was friendly and attentive. Our server, Maria was wonderful. There was also another male server working near our area who also helped to remove our dirty dishes who was also friendly as well. \n\nOverall, this buffet definitely raises the bar for buffets in Sin City and would come back here again.\n\nBy the way, this buffet is located in Caesar's Palace towards one end of the hotel. Make sure to ask employees where it is and don't come here starving. When we arrived, it took us 20 minutes to figure out where this buffet was at after we parked in the self parking area. Wished there were more signs around the casino to better direct us.","review_id":"U2bZJbopBsT2eCy4fUB_2w","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":4,"useful":8,"user_id":"3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg","date":"2014-11-26"},{"cool":0,"text":"I heard this was the best place ever!

Truly a juxtaposition of colors, textures and flavors.  Sounds like I'm reviewing a Masterpiece?  Maybe I am. This new Vegas vibe is dominating the strip and Caesar's Palace was not going to be left behind. \n\nSince this was my first visit I wasn't expecting to love everything, however, the distinguishing characteristic of a buffet for me is that the simplest dishes should taste the best, especially when they're served with such elegance and style as they were here. \n\nI'll name a list a few tips, hits and some items that surprisingly fell short:\n \nCrab legs!   Ask the chef to steam them (although they get busy so you may have to wait) Also I wish the clarified butter was closer to the crabs because there's a door that will slam into you-like it did me-when I was in the area. \n\nThe variety of stations was overwhelming. Chinese, Sushi, Ramen station, Southern comfort food, Seafood (oyster shooters, Paella, oysters on the half shell, ceviche), Italian, Mediterranean, and Mexican-which was my favorite. \n\nTamales (very very good moist and full of flavor), Posole with toppings (I will have to try this next time), a revolving cast iron griddle for home made tortillas, Street tacos, Sopes, at least 12 different types of salsa, mushroom soup-my favorite, fajitas, etc. I wonder if they serve Pan Dulce for breakfast? \n\nBacchanal buffet is paying attention to its clientele and lots of them come from South of the Border. Did you know that the richest man in the world is a tycoon from Mexico City named Carlos Slim?  Tiffany & Co. in Vegas Crystals should take notes.  I'm sure if he came here, he wouldn't mind some traditional dishes!\n\nDisappointments:  Mexican corn on the cob.  Although the presentation was worthy of a cookbook cover, the flavor lacked and the the corn and husk took up too much room on the plate. If you're going to do street vendor food another option is to shave the kernels to save me the work and put them in a cup. The fajita type beef with peppers was not good, meat was tough and chewy. Table service gets a two-star. Piles of dishes were stacking up and I didn't get my drink until \"round two\". Saw waitress only one other time.\n\nAt the seafood stand Halibut was dry. Lobster corn chowder lacked flavor. The layout of the dining room left you weaving in and out of people's tables.  Another downer, some foods were served in small dishes, baskets or mini cast iron bowls so it was hard getting too many items and it made the plate heavy.\n\nI'd have to say the highlight was the 5-star dessert station.  A huge selection of sweetness. Candy jars, gelato, macarons, cake pops, creme brûlée, and leave room for a freshly made crepe and a banana soufflé on request!  \n\nAnother highlight was the 5-star service at each kitchen.  I've been to many buffets and the servers behind the counter are usually stoic even those chefs at brunches that leave a tip jar for an omelet but can't even say \"hello\". Here, they went out of their way to make sure you were being helped. I was here with a Yelp group and had a name tag BUT I did see other patrons being helped in the same courteous manner.\n\nLoved the music, creativity of presentation, value, variety of food. A fabulous gourmet spread surely to satisfy every one of your tastebuds.  I plan on coming back with guests and a hearty appetite!","review_id":"z90trninSpxtfIudgiymwg","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":11,"useful":19,"user_id":"uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ","date":"2012-09-24"},{"cool":1,"text":"So this is probably the most expensive buffet I will ever pay for in my life. But it was pretty awesome for a few reasons.\n\nTheir paella is awesome. OMG so good, the sausages and cuts of beef are delicious. Their sushi is top notch. The mini lasagnas are great. Their pizza is so-so. I could rack my brains for a while to try and remember just the vast array of world cuisine you can get. They even have good mediterranean food, but was a bit bummed they didn't have an Indian buffet section.\n\nA big reason this is as expensive as it is is definitely the seafood section, they have Alaskan king crab, snow carb, etc. Its all fresh and amazing and you're subsidizing that no doubt. But you will have a moment if youre not used to spending a couple hundred almost for 2 people for one meal where you think, \"oh man I could eat at _____ for a 10th of this.\" Also you'll fill up soon and think man there's just so many choices, if you like one item are you cheating yourself by getting more of it by trying another of it versus a new food item? Needless to say anything that was just meh I didnt finish. But its totally worth it to do it at least once. \n\nThere is usually a huge line for this place around dinner. Shoot for early bird. We waited like 20 minutes or so and my feet hurt from walking on the strip. The layout is nothing too special IMO for seating - all the food stations are like continuous in a cafeteria buffet kind of way except for the dessert which is off to itself in the middle. It starts with seafood, then Spanish, meats, American-ish, Mexican, Italian, Med, then Asian cuisines til the end pretty much. They bring you your drinks and its a cool thing to check out if youre staying at Caesar's.","review_id":"tZ4FujvOLTBSVtyvGvcd7Q","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":1,"user_id":"w0B7U_-vU2y7O2rpzR2nbA","date":"2014-10-12"},{"cool":0,"text":"Pro Tip: Go to the Italian section to get hot crab legs.\n\nI really want to give this place 5 stars, but I just can't do it.  The reason I can't do it is because this buffet is not what it once was.  The items that i loved most are no longer served.  Those would be the king crab legs, lamb chops, and the blue fin tuna.  All you get now are snow crab legs and the low grade color added tuna that isn't that appealing.  \n\nOn to the good stuff.  What I do like are the snow crab legs, bloody mary oyster shooters (this was so good), osso bucco, prime rib, beef ribs, dim sum, noodle bar (pho, udon, ramen, and a few others), and made to order street tacos.  I think the highlight of the buffet is their dessert section.  You've got everything including freshly made crepes.  Call me crazy, but the best item in the ENTIRE buffet are the gummy bears.  This isn't your ordinary gummy bears my friend.  Oh no no no.  I'm not sure where they get them from, but these gummy bears are the best you'll ever have in your life!!  I ate a huge bowl of them.  They are that good.\n\nFor the quality of food you get and the price you pay, I'd say the value isn't quite there anymore.  It used to be the best buffet and the best value.

You can get your crab legs steamed by the employees behind the station and the butter dispenser at the end of the station looks dangerously good. The carved meats looked and tasted amazing.

I need to find myself the recipe because it was that good. In the dessert section, I tried the carrot cake which was good. The chocolate lava cake however was overcooked and burnt on the edges. You definitely can't go wrong with the gelato. I really liked the Nutella and strawberry balsamic flavors. The best part of dessert were the cupcakes.

The line wasn't bad at all considering how new and popular this place is right now.  Just standing in line was exciting because you can see the seafood section right at the entrance.  \n\nAs they walk you in, the hostess tells you about the buffet, pointing out the sections and letting you know as you pass the American counter that \"it's not over yet\".  Around the corner from the main entrance is even more food stations--Asia, Italy, and a hint of Europe thrown in.  \n\nAfter being seated and greeted by Miguel, we headed to the back corner of the buffet--Asia.  I tried my very first soup dumpling, which was tender and explodes in your mouth.  I could eat fifty of those.  The sushi counter is great because it is the ONLY sushi bar in Vegas I know of that utilizes ebi furai in the roll instead of regular tempura--just the way I like it (that's how they did it up in Japan when we went and back on Guam as I was growing up, so I love ebi furai in sushi).

I'm highly disappointed and disgusted . So much variety,  yet not one delicious dish.  I love quality,  I guess I will have to be content with quantity.  But I won't,  I refuse to conform to the masses.\n\nThe wait time here for dinner after 3pm ranges from hour and a half to three hours.  You get a ticket stamped with a time to come back at.  Once you're in,  you are seated and then you can join the frenzy of other dinners trying to grab the \"best of the buffet\".  The best probably being the crab legs and oysters. Or the California rolls (they call it sushi) or a mosh posh of pasta , Mexican ground beef hard shell tacos,  Chinese chop suey or overly mayo clams.  U pick your poison. \n\nWhen everything is said and done or half eaten you're left with a full belly of despair and dissatisfaction. \n \nNext time family or friends come in from out of town,  they're on their own if the suggest we eat at a buffet.","review_id":"WCtxTqf5QqR2mI1uK03HvQ","stars":1,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":2,"useful":2,"user_id":"RoJCMSycQZGEefAh8-OHJg","date":"2014-06-07"},{"cool":3,"text":"I've only been here via the awesome Yelp event, so I haven't had the experience of the long line... which makes me think that I won't be coming back until the crowd dies down a little (within 6 months or so).  My first critique would be that the buffet is placed quite awkwardly, the lines are definitely causing traffic for people passing by.\n\nSecond would be the Asian food. The Chinese bbq pork, though the cuts were HUGE, was missing some authentic flavor. All I could taste was honey. Their dimsum was good, except that since they've been out for quite some time they dried up a little bit. The positive thing though is that their Pad Thai tasted great. I know some buffets have attempted featuring this dish and failed miserably. Bacchanal however, did good on this one; it had the right spice level and wasn't mushy in texture. Their sushi was okay. Definitely better than other strip buffets that offers them, yes, but not much variety either. Then again, Bacchanal is not strictly sushi so it's understandable. I've seen some curry somewhere and wanted to try them, but couldn't find a bigger bowl. Have to remind myself to try them next time. \n\nI enjoyed the \"American\" dishes like: scalloped potatoes, prime rib, calamari, sweet potato truffle fries (was the BEST sweet potato fries I've ever tasted), pasta, glazed veggies, etc. I would say that their mini burger sliders was uh-maaay-zing! It was perfectly medium rare, a little salty with melted cheese on top, and buttery buns to tie it all off. Their pasta was al-dente and rightfully sauced (I hate over-sauced pasta, but not dry either). They had flavor, not bland at all. Scalloped potatoes were a little too salty for me. I think it was the breadcrumbs, but I just brushed them aside and tasted the potatoes. I love me some potatoes. Their meat selection was all juicy, melty goodness; but I only had room for the prime rib. It was too rare for my taste, but the part that I did end up eating was delicious. \n\nI didn't get the chance to try their seafood, since I eat seafood almost on a daily basis so yeah... skipped those for now. I do plan on trying them on my next visit. \n\nDessert... there are too many good words to say about dessert. Since they have a crepe station I definitely had to try it. I got one with strawberries, REAL whipped cream, and Nutella sauce yum! I wished they'd put the toppings inside instead of on top, but that's just a personal preference. They had so much dessert selection that I was going dizzy (or maybe that was the wine?). I ended up trying their Aztec chocolate gelato, chocolate praline cake, chocolate creme brulee, and various macarons. The gelato was quite interesting. I'm not a big cinnamon fan at all but I devoured that aztec choco like it was the end of the world. It wasn't overly sweet with a hint of spicy kick. Loves it! Chocolate praline cake was so heavenly, I almost cried. If I had an extra stomach, I would definitely grab some more. Choco creme brulee was so-so. Maybe I should have tried the vanilla one instead. To me, the highlight was the french macarons. I grabbed one for each flavor. My favorite was the rose flavored one and green tea flavored macarons. \n\nI've never been so impressed over a buffet before. I've been to quite a number already, and honestly it all seems redundant. I'm glad that Caesar's Palace decided to open one that has more to offer than \"the usual.\"","review_id":"tWQ3bGyYJBrkZ2yaiD_LJQ","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":3,"user_id":"YUzqKt7hmG5BkRykHeZ0gg","date":"2012-09-22"},{"cool":2,"text":"This used to be one of my favorite buffets.

If the deal isn't here... it's probably somewhere online.\n\nI just won't say its the best because I haven't been to all of them and probably never will.  What makes Bacchanal different from the other buffets is size and presentation!  Any foodie knows the better food looks, the better it tastes!  Every station has an individual characteristic that makes the food feel special.  Individual pots for the ravioli, fry baskets for chicken and fries, plated hamburgers, individual selections of fresh juices... I could go on and on.  The sushi station was great because it had hand rolls, nigiri sushi, and regular rolls.  The best part: the nigiri sushi is served so you can get as many pieces as you want, not on individual plates like some other buffets which limit your ability to get a large quantity.

OMG I don't get these reviews at all. I live in LV so I admit that I resist buffets but we had visitors in town so we had this at the top of our list. First of all, we get in line and a pleasant employee tells us the line is 90 minutes at our point but we can each buy a $15 fast pass so we can zip into the vip line. Well, we decided to decline that generous offer and lo and behold.....the 90 minute line was actually 40 minutes. Just a ploy to get you to part with more money. When we did get in, there were multiple empty tables that stayed empty the entire time we dined. Seems like they just want to build excitement and keep the buffet line long so they can sell some more of those \"fast passes\". \n\nThe buffet stations were ill kept and congested. There were a few small plate standouts, but the bbq station had one guy trying to carve for too many folks. The server NEVER brought us refills and our plates stacked up around us. It appeared that they did not have enough bus help or servers on the floor. I hate it when I am surrounded by dirty dishes. It certainly did not live up to the reputation many have expressed here. Really LOUD too!\n\nKing crab was the worst quality I have EVER eaten. What a joke! Desserts were beautiful, but after a bite of several, I left them on my plate. UGH! Lousy quality for such lovely looking plates. The diabetic dessert consisted of three choices. I am only grateful that we tried this before we wasted a ton of money bringing our family members here during the holiday.\n\nLike I said, I don't care for buffets, but if I were to consider any, I would go to the \"M\" resort with way better service, food & ambiance and even free wine and beer with the buffet.

How cool would that be if they had a little naan station though?!?!  Anyway, there's nothing really out of the ordinary that they offer.  Every station had \"American\" staples that Americans enjoy most.  \n\nChinese: pecking duck, chow main, dim sum, fried rice.  Italian: pizza, pasta, meatballs, Japanese: miso soup, ramen, rolls, nigiri.  Stuff like that.  The standard fare any buffet pretty much offers.  I didn't see anything that stood out or made me feel like... \"Damn, this ish was worth $50!\n\nI go to buffets because of the variety.  I can't say I ever eat my money's worth, but I really did want to put forth the effort and try everything so I can be as fair as possible in my review.\n\nThe crab legs were a total fail as well.  It was too salty and overcooked.  I love indulging on crab legs during my visits to a buffet, but I couldn't even finish the plate they gave me.  *it is nice that they offer warm & cold though.\n\nI'm actually a little disappointed cause the pictures posted gave me a lot of hope!  I really thought it was going to live up to all its hype.  They didn't offer some of the stuff pictured.  I went on a Sunday night if that makes a difference.\n\nI thought their desserts were just ok.  I prefer the one at the Wynn for sure.  They offered a lot of different pastries, but they looked better than they tasted.  The gelato selection wasn't too great, but I did like the baklava flavor!  They also had mango chile, which reminded me of those Mexican candies!  Yum!  There was a crepe station as well.\n\nI didn't experience the service you other yelpers are talking about.  My server took our drink orders and that's about it.  I was with a party if six and we were stacking plates ourselves pushing them to the side.  There was a girl who kept coming to clear them out.  She also replenished our drinks.  Our server started doing his job towards the end, when we were just about ready to finish up.  I paid for my group with CC and wanted to tip with cash after we finished.  I don't know if that made a difference, but i'm sure we probably would've received better service if I had tipped upfront.  Again, that shouldn't matter, but service was nonexistent for my group.\n\nOverall, I probably won't come back.  The quality of the food was better than most buffets, but Wynn would still be my choice.  I think ambiance has a lot to do with it as well.  The decor at bacchanal was kind of bland.

The hostess gives you little finger protectors so that you can pick up all the hot plates without scorching a finger or two.

The prices are a head-scratcher now since they only have 2 price options for brunch and dinner.  It's pretty messed up in my opinion but from a business sense I could understand why they're doing it since a lot of people usually came early for breakfast before and stuck around long enough for the lunch items, saving them money in the process.\n\nPaying $40 for brunch seems almost ridiculous to me considering that just a while ago, dinner at the Wynn Buffet was $35.  At that price point, I really would rather just get a simple breakfast meal at Mon Ami Gabi or Bouchon.  Plus, I can't stuff myself silly as I used to when I was younger, so I really can't do buffets anymore.  Case in point, with this visit I only did 3 plates and called it a day.  But I definitely made sure that I got my money's worth.\n\nFirst off, I made sure that I had plenty of cold pressed juices.  I think I had 4 bottles of their Hibiscus Berry Juice.  It was so refreshing and lightly sweetened.\n\nOn to the food plates.\n\n1st Plate -- http://bit.ly/2kxIuTP\nBloody Mary Oyster Shooter, Veal Osso Bucco, Rolled Sole, Coconut Ceviche Shooter\nThe best thing on this plate was their veal osso bucco and it was amazing!  If I wasn't going to try anything else at Bacchanal, I probably would've had more of this.  The marrow was dangerously good and the braised veal was so tender.\n\n2nd Plate -- http://bit.ly/2kxtdSO\nPickled Greens, Spicy Thai Beef, Poke Salad\nI think with my second plate, I made a huge a mistake and had a huge amount of poke salad.  That immediately filled me up.\n\nBecause I was already reaching complete fullness after just two plates, I went straight to dessert.  And my dessert plate was loaded!!\n\n3rd Plate -- http://bit.ly/2kxtq8t\nSugar Free Mango Pudding, Limoncello Sorbet, Ginger Gelato, Bonet, Exotic Fruit Sago, Green Tea & Sesame Seed Opera Cake\nI'm not much of sweets person, but honestly, this was the best overall plate of food I had from the whole buffet.  Everything was good, but my faves were definitely the Limocello Sorbet and the Exotic Fruit Sago.  Both were very sweet and refreshing!\n\nAll in all, Bacchanal is still my buffet of choice on the Strip, just slightly edging by Wicked Spoon.  It's a still a great dining experience when you're with a group and the food selection is still great and extensive, but it's not one buffet that I'd rush back to visit again and again simply because it's become way too expensive.","review_id":"G7z3JXIjxv4R6HaB5lmy7g","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":16,"useful":24,"user_id":"F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw","date":"2017-02-06"},{"cool":8,"text":"My girlfriends were leaving Vegas a day earlier than the rest of us.

The line wasn't bad at all and we got to the front within 5-10 minutes.\n\nThe lunch buffet is $39.99 with a 2 hour limit. Though I don't think they really enforce that as we were there until almost 5:30pm. The girls took part in the $22 all you care to drink mimosas, while the guys did the beer version. You also get to keep the glass as a souvenir. With the mimosas you can control the amount of juice, so if you just want sparkling wine, they will give it to you sans OJ.\n\nWe all hit the seafood first and loaded up on shrimp, oyster shooters, ceviches, crawfish, clams, mussels and crab claws. I actually started feeling full after we hit the seafood station, but I continued with the gluttony and hit the American food section. Grabbed some meat from the carving station, soups, salads, side dishes, etc. Now I'm hitting a food wall, but I decided to barge through it by hitting the Asian section. Loaded up on dim dum, roast pork, duck, etc. I skipped the sushi as it was mostly rolls. One of my friends got the ramen which looked delish, but I skipped it as I was trying to make room for the oysters and crab legs that just came out. So yes, I ventured back to the seafood section. Clarified butter and crab legs? Yes please!\n\nI know there were many more plates than what I mentioned and took pix of, but I was too busy eating and thinking about what to eat next to remember to take pictures of everything. Though all the dessert I consumed was photographed. I just made myself a little dessert platter and got some gelato. I loved the matcha covered strawberry. The brulee and flan were also pretty good. Of the gelato flavors, I really only liked the black sesame. The raspberry hibiscus was too sweet and the green tea tasted like soap.\n\n$62 for four hours of eating and drinking. All I can say is I've never felt that full in my life! I really wish I could have had even more, but there was no way I could stomach anything else. Even I got to a point where I could drink anymore.

It has to revolutionize buffets as we know it.  Short of serving Unicorn and Dragon meat, Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace delivers.  WOW and do they deliver.  I am going to give you an idea of what they were serving this Saturday night I went and do a little review on the food.\n\nAs you enter, you see the \"modern\", fresh clean look of the restaurant.  They have different stations and they actually cook your food, made to order at each station!  The line starts with the seafood.   They have someone that offers to steam your snow crab legs or you can get it off the rack cold.  They have 4 people in the back schucking Oysters and the had a Monster pile of large shrimp.  Curve around the corner you they have small plates of food ready to go (a la Wicked spoon).  Clam bake, Seafood Piaia, boiled shrimp w/head on, Lobster chowder..etc.\n\nThe next station is the bar b que station.  They were cutting brisket and cowboy bone in steaks.  Chicken and fries, Mac and cheese..etc.\n\nWe then have an Artisan bread station (which I did not try) and goes to the Mexican Food station.  Fresh made tortillas to order, with Al Pastor cut from the rack!  Amazing Salsa bar.\n\nThen it curves around to the italian station with Pizza, pasta, Lasagna, meatballs etc...  Continues to a Cheese and meat station (yes they have a designated section entirely of meat and cheeses.)\n\nContinuing down the line to the Salad Station and then the made to order Noodle bar!  They Noodle bar makes Ramen, Wonton noodles, and Pho.  \n\nNow to the Asian Section.  they had Amazing Duck (large Large pieces), Char Sui, Moves to Sushi then to Japanese Curry station with Chinese Porridge.\n\nIf that was not enough, it moves to the Dim sum section (Har Gow, Shui Mai, Sho Long Bai, Lotus wrapped rice, Char Shui Bao etc..)  Then finally to the Asian noodle section (Pad Thai, Fried noodles..etc.)\n\nI did not event mention the dessert section which features a Crepe (made to order) section, Candy bar (yes like at weddings), Banana's Foster, Gelato and Amazing Maccaroons (that rival Payard's across the way).\n\nPhew, that was just from the amazing memory of seeing everything, but to give you a review of the food:\n\nNoodle Bar:  Worth the trip alone!  I went back twice for the Ramen Noodles.  They serve it in their special Tonkotsu broth.  AMAZING. You would think you were at a Ramen house.  Not too salty, but savory with a hint of pork fat.  I added a piece of duck in it to give it a bit more emphasis.  I went back twice to get it !\n\nMexican Taco's:  Had the Al Pastor.  It was very flavorful and the tortilla really makes this taco great.  Like any great taco place, they made the tortilla fresh and put the Al Pastor on it.  I would suggest getting the taco and moving to the salsa bar and put your own toppings.  \n\nSeafood Bar:  I had the cooked snow crab legs and they were sweet and on point.  I liked it better than the cold version.  The fresh Oysters were great also!  I am weary about raw items at a Buffet, but the quality was great and it had a great sweet, smooth taste with only hint of the ocean on the backside.  Perfect!  The Lobster chowder was smokey (from the bacon) and smooth.  Very good.\n\nMeat Cutting station:  The lamb chops were the best ever.  I used to think the Wynn buffet Lamb Chops were great, but these were twice as big, medium rare and just a little gamey.  They are a must.  I did not try anything else, but the Brisket and the Cowboy steak looked perfectly cooked.\n\nThe Dim sum was good not great.  Har gow skin was thick and the Shui Mai was ok.  Sho long bai was a bit dry, but we are not going to get HK dim sum at any buffett.\n\nI made a plate of Duck and Char Shui rice (like at Sam woo)  The Duck was as good as any Chinese Restaurant with large chunks, a lot of meat.  Sweet and great skin, I found this to be one of the best part of the meal, since i also put it in the noodles.\n\nI had the Nutella/Banana Crepe and it was wonderful, but the Macaroons were the star of the buffet.  I had to ask if they were from Payards, and they told me were not, but the place that brings it in always gets mistaken for the Payards Macaroons.  They sweet, crispy with just a hint of the \"jam\" layer.  Not over powering, just right.\n\nI used to think the Sterling Brunch was the best Buffet.  Although it still is one of the best I found the fresh food stations, made to order, put Bacchanal over the top.  Next to the lobster tails w/Caviar at Sterling Brunch, Bacchanal is the new sherriff in town and I highly recommend to everyone!","review_id":"Ol24_kYXIWvzkY4wRdLdWw","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":4,"user_id":"gk8l75GLFUsFr0kS5uLtkQ","date":"2012-09-23"},{"cool":0,"text":"Wow this place is unreal its like you died and ended up \nIn buffet heaven.

I saw that a few Yelpers complained about not getting enough attention - no one checked on them or refilled their water. Well, this was not the case for me. The busboy waited on us and was super attentive. It was great that he pitched in since we barely saw our actual waiter. I think our waiter was too busy with all the other tables he was in charge of. Water, tea, and drinks were a plenty for us and our plates were promptly cleared! \n\nThe food. OH THE FOOD! \n\nBefore I grabbed anything I walked around to see what kind of foods they offered. So much of everything. I was impressed with their Asian selection. It's not the best, but it's a few notches higher than what other buffets offer. Also, their cheese station!! DROOL~ So much seafood! \n\nTo get my money's worth, I avoided the Asian, Italian, and Mexican stations! I only hit up the seafood, meat carving, and dessert. I did try some cheese though because I couldn't help it. I also got a scoop of veggies just to be healthy. \n\nCrab legs and oysters were fresh. They had some miso glazed seabass which I got several plates of. Really yummy! The lamb chops were really good too. Everything was high quality and well made like you could get at a fine restaurant. \n\nI would probably make a whole meal out of their desserts if I could.

On the last night of our staycation, that dream turned into a reality. \n\n Outside the Buffet there is a plaque on the wall. It says, \"Bacchus: The Roman God of the Feast. Bacchanal: A Feast worthy of Gods.\"  I don't think the Gods would appreciate the lengthy cue to get in the first line of the buffet. A negative of Bacchanal Buffet is the endless lengthy lines. In my opinion, the buffet arrangement exacerbates these lines. Caesar's Palace would be doing a good service to their guests by putting up a sign stating the approximate wait time from this point forward. The line did move relatively fast. And by the time I wrote my review on Bellagio Snack's we were paying for the dinner. At $44.99 per person with $1 off for Reward members (whoopee!), Bacchanal Buffet does not love locals. After we paid, they gave us a rubber thing that you use to hold on to the hot plates. Next we waited on a second line to be seated. After waiting on this line for a few minutes, we were directed to wait on another line. A few minutes pass. Finally, a hostess walks us to our table. The first thing that struck my eyes was the dessert station in the center of the buffet.\n\n  After we are seated, we got a quick course on the different stations and their locations. From that point on, I rate the service a 3 out of 5. Piles of empty dishes sat on the table far too long. The drink refills could have been better.\n\n  I started from one end of the buffet to the other. This review mentions the stations and a sample of the food at some of them. I have posted comments where applicable:\n\nASIAN FOOD\n\n*Vegetable chow mein........Delicious.\n*Kung Poa Chicken\n*Beef broccoli\n*Spring rolls.........Good.\n*Man Po Todu\n*Miso soup......Not hot. Like Garden Buffets way more.\n*BBQ ribs\n*Chinese roasted duck\n*Duck soup..Coming from a guy developing a list on places to view ducks, I won't eat it again.\n\nSALAD\n\n*Typical salad....Will not spend $44.99 to eat salad.\n\nCOLD CUTS\n\n*A wide selection of cold cuts.\n\nITALIAN FOOD\n\n*Large meatballs\n*Chicken Primavera\n*Urchette\n*Baked Beef Lasagna with ricotta.....small dishes. Good stuff\n\nMEXICAN FOOD\n\n *Large selection\n\nAMERICAN FOOD\n\n*Prime rib\n*Lamb chops.....My dad & brother said it was the best they tasted.\n\nSEAFOOD\n\n*Lobster soup\n*crab legs\n*cocktail shrimp\n*gulf shrimp\n*mussels\n*Cod\n\nDESSERTS\n\n*Pecan sticky buns\n*French macaroons\n*large selection of sorbet\n*chocolate crème brulee\n*Chocolate Decadence pops\n*Chocolate Chip filled with fudge\n*sugar free cheese cake\n*sugar free vanilla brulee\n*peanut butter cupcakes\n*red velvet cake\n*pecan tarts\n*key lime cake\n*panna cotta\n\nConclusion:\n\n   It was a difficult decision whether to rate Bacchanal Buffet 3 or 4 stores. I was not happy that the miso soup was cold. I was not happy about the extended wait at the seafood station. I am under the impression that a poor layout is creating this long line that moves exceedingly slow. I was going to give it 3.75 stars. This is the reason that I am giving Bacchanal Buffet a soft 4 stars. One of the people in my party was in a rush. The result is that I passed over coffee and dessert. This looked like the king of dessert stations (I would probably only get a cookie). The coffee also could have been outstanding. \n\n My dream of dining in the Bacchanal Buffet is over. The constant lines and high pricing leave me with better dining options on the Strip in the near future. As it stands right now, Bacchanal may return to Rome by the time I pay $44.99 to return to Bacchanal Buffet.\n\nThe Yelp 100 Challenge.

A few worth mentioning are the Tomahawk 30 day aged prime rib eye is only offered after a certain time for dinner. A wide variety of mochi ice creams were added to the dessert station about a year ago that I absolutely loved.

There is no question this place is beautiful.\nFact - The bounty is plentiful.  This is the stuff that could trigger sensory overload...think Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory but with more than just candy.  \nFact - Their dim sum is better than most regular Chinese dim sum places I've been to in Orange County.  Sad to say but it's true!\n\nUnfortunately, the ultimate fact is...unless, you're some type of competitive eater (or secretly employ the use of a vomitorium like they used to do in the olden Bacchanal days), you're only eating 1/3 of what you're paying for the buffet.  Everything else is going to the cost of décor and excess food.  \"Getting your money's worth\" is a purely subjective mission here.\n\nAs beautiful as the rest of the place was, hubby and I got shoved into what appeared to be an overflow room where our chairs didn't match and our table was no better than a two top in a French café.\n\nFood was plentiful as I mentioned and nothing really stood out. It was definitely a shock and awe type feeling.\n\nMy biggest issue with this place was the service.  Our server was ok, not super attentive so we didn't get refills unless we craned our necks to flag him down.  The biggest offender, however, was the surly possibly racist jerk at the carving station.  I witnessed him being openly rude to a meek lady with limited English skills and then suddenly offering the next few Caucasian people the biggest brightest smiles and an almost subservient tone of voice.  When it was my turn, I was once again shocked at his brusqueness and his rude tone of voice.  I smiled/chuckled and asked him if he actually gave away the entire ribeye to which his reply was an icy glare accompanied with \"No, you can't have the whole steak.\" I ended up with the worst, fattiest cut he could scrounge up for me.  My next visit to his station was wordless even when I attempted some banter.  I'm typically a \"live and let live\" type of person but if I ever run into this guy again, I believe will call him out on his rudeness.  A subsequent courtesy email to Caesar's customer service received no response.\n\nAs other Yelpers have noted, it's more expensive than typical buffets out there.

Bacchanal...yes bacch - ANAL...named formerly from the God of Wine and Festivities/Intoxication...BACCHUS!\n\nAnywho...this buffet is a MUST GET for me. I WILL NOT LEAVE VEGAS WITHOUT DINING HERE! YEs its that GUUD! In fact...I would even be willing to skip out on a night of clubbing to dine here! Yep thats right...I would rather get a table at BACCHANAL vs. XS, MARQUEE, SURRENDER, etc...\n\nHeres a lil 411 on this buffet. Caesars Palace placed $15 MILLION into this buffet. Let me say this again...they put $15 FREAKING MILLION! With over 25,000 square feet and over 500 items to choose from...yah this place is going to be guud. Lets go on an adventure inside...\n\nWhat makes this place so guud? Here are my reasons and some things; errrr I mean many things that stand out to me:\n-most buffets are either known for their quantity (but with high quantity comes low quality) or quality (with high quality...comes with low quantity). This place has the right balance of both but to an even greater extent. In my world and my eyes...BACCHANAL has the MOST QUANTITY WITH THE HIGHEST QUALITY!\n-No joke...this buffet line is LONG!\n-the orange juice here...next to the seafood section...this is seriously the best tasting orange juice that Ive ever had. If there was a GUINNESS BOOK WORLD RECORDS ON BEST TASTING ORANGE JUICE...this place would have to be it\n-I usually judge a buffet by its prime rib, pasta, fried chicken, and pizza. Yes the prime rib is so tender and juicy. Yes the pasta is al dente to the correct italian taste w/o any liquidy runny pasta sauce. The fried chicken is crisp and juicy...just how its suppose to be. And the pizza...finally...crust with a crunch...and toppings that dont slide off as your about to bite into it. WIN!\n-they have a noodle bar! Big plus for me...I love noodles...especially as a hangover meal. The selection they have are: PHO, UDON, RAMEN\n-I love HOT AND SOUR SOUP...any buffet with this soup is a win! and this place has it! Obviously Im a huge noodle fan...my lil secret is to get noodles from the asian noodle bar...and add hot and sour soup to it. One of my favorite Taiwanese/Chinese soup and noodle dishes.\n-the BBQ and MEAT section....drool for days that I could make a puddle. The BRISKET...errr maiii godd. So guud. They also have a variety of sausages...from turkey to spiced to artisan, etc... FAT SLABS OF BACON...yes thats right!! and others as well too\n-a TACO BAR? cant be that great right? WRONG! with their homemade salsas and avocado sauce...the tacos are quite yummy to be honest.\n-etc...\n\nAs you can see...and from the ratings and blogs from all over the net...BACCHANAL...is the number 1 buffet in Vegas...and definitely top 3 if not. It is a must go for everyone...and obviously me of course. \n\nPut this way...when I come to vegas...its not that Im excited to gamble...its not that Im excited to night club...its not that Im excited to day party (well sometimes I am)...IM EXCITED TO EAT AT BUFFETS...specifically this one!\n\nVERY VERY WELL RECOMMENDED...this is a MUST GO!\n\nUNTIL THEN!! ^-^","review_id":"oqa34iQsi_AEz2w_cUNbWg","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":11,"useful":14,"user_id":"W7ugM1NqQeB1Wj0DYE8TYw","date":"2013-06-07"},{"cool":2,"text":"Not going to write too much because i wasnt really satisfied with this buffet.\n\nI expected a little more food, i mean they had the seafood part down but the other food was just ok. \n\nI went crazy for their raw oysters but that was pretty much it. \n\nTheir dessert bar was really good, they had fresh made crepes and cake pops.

Showed up around 5 and probably waited about an hour in line. Yeah - there's usually a wait and we thought 5 was early but maybe we should've came even earlier. Plunked down out $55 (ouch!) and got seated. Service was so-so. Our waiter was kinda scarce and spacey. It took a while to get our drinks, to get refills, to get our tables cleared. But then at the end, another guy/waiter showed up and asked multiple times about refills and clearing our tables even though we were ok and still working on our food. I don't think he was taking over for our original waiter because he was still around but it felt like this new guy was like the expediter, trying to hurry us along to finish and leave. Weird vibes throughout. \n\nOn to the food. Like Wicked Spoon, I think I would be happy just having their dessert (but then I wouldn't get my money's worth). It's truly an impressive spread. Mutiple flavors of ice scream and we're talking about unique flavors too like mango chile or French toast. Mochi - though we looked behind the counter and it's just from the box that you can get at the grocery store so maybe save your stomach for something else. Fresh crepes which you can customize with fruits and sauces and whip cream. Bowls of macaroons, jars of candy, all different kinds of mini desserts, chocolate covered strawberries, cake pops, and it goes on and on. For the actual food, there's mainly 3 sections. An ethnic section with Italian, Mexican, and Asian foods as well as some salads/soup. A meat and hot food line with prime rib, a variety of hot meats, and sides like veggies and mashed potatoes. And finally the seafood section - crab legs (steamed or cold), shrimp, lobster bisque, oysters, clam bakes, etc. I would have to say my top three favorite things were the blackened chicken soup (Chinese herb-y style), the lamb (cooked and seasoned perfectly) and the macaroons (love these delicate desserts).

Coming here on a Saturday, the price per person was $52 + tax. (-1 dollar if you have their players card). \n\nThe wait time wasnt too bad. Since they changed it to the electronic \"fast pass\" system, our wait was about an hour. You can also input your cell number for text reminders. We decided to walk around the forum shops. \n\nWe got through to pay fairly quick and were seated maybe, 5-10 minutes later. We were seated right next to the Dessert Station, right where the chocolate dipped strawberries were. *drools* \n\nFirst plate, meat station ! Both Doriee and I went for this first. Main reason we came here was because a friend came into town, and wanted lamb chops for dinner. Aside from our usual place to get lamb chops, we decided to try a new place. Since he hasnt been to the Bacchanal Buffet, here we went ! (despite my crying wallet Q_Q) Back to the story. When i arrived at the meat carving station, i asked for a slice of prime rib. then the lamb chops. here's how the conversation went between the carver and myself\n\nMe: Can i get some lamb chops?\nChef: How many? \nMe: uhh 4?\nChef: 4? 5? 10?\nMe: *joking* however many you want to give me ! ! !\n\ndot dot dot . . .\n\n*watches the chef use his tongs, and dig deep into the platter of lamb chops and grabbed all it can, and piled it on my plate.* For the record, he put SEVEN lamb chops on my plate. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED ! OM NOM NOM ! He did the same thing with Doriee but she stood firm on her request of 3, and would just pick off mine if she wanted more. \n\nTo give an idea on the SIZE of these lamb chops. In comparison to like the the lamb chops from Koi (Australian? New Zealand?) or from Brio Tuscan Grille, these were at least 2-3x the size... EACH.. oh boy... what did i get myself into. They were heavy enough to make my arm tired from carrying it around to get more food ! x_x I could easily say, they were an easy 1-2lb of MEAT. yeah i ate it all. Meat temp wise, was a hit and miss. throughout everyone at the table, we got about a 50% chance of getting a perfect med rare cook. other 50% was medium or higher. Flavor was good. Overall great lamb chops !\n\nPrime rib was a bit dry. Kind of sad. \n\nCrab was hot (station now at italian area). Butter still by the seafood station though. \nCocktail shrimps were huge. Enough to make me take 2 bites instead of the usual 1 bite chomp-age. \nOyster was fat and fresh. Not completely clean but not bad. I think i had a baby pearl in mine too XD \n\nChicken Ginseng Soup is NOT in individual clay bowls anymore. I guess thats a good thing, so it prevents me from burning my fingers over and over trying to get it... Lol. Flavor was pretty good. I do believe they added salt to the soup though (we never do at home). No sight of ginseng anymore (sad ! i like eating ginseng too) \n\nDESSERTS !\n\nyeah by the time i reached this stage, i was pretty stuffed over limit already. Previously noted chocolate strawberries were all gone for the night. Limited to 1 per person. \n\nSouffles ! my fav ! fresh made to order ! piping hot out of the oven !\n\npistachio - Light ! flavorful ! little sweet ! great with a cup of coffee ! \nchocolate - super rich x_x chocolate-y ! DEFINITELY needed the coffee otherwise i'd have trouble finishing this. \nchurros - short pieces of churro, freshly made. nice and hot. filled in the middle with a pastry cream. \n\nOverall experience. Great ! Service was a bit slow on picking up used/empty plates.

When I first heard of this buffet, I seen it advertised for $25 with a list of items including soufflé and king crab. Neither of which were offered the day I came, nor was the price $25. I wasn't too worried about the cost, if it was up to par. \nThere was a wide seafood variety and I'm sure many will not like that I seen this section as a \"con\"  but IMO, if you offer King, then don't have it, at very minimum offer steamed snow crab! There were oyster shooters, clam bakes, and different variety shrimp, salmon and halibut. None of it blew me away. \nI luckily arrived at around 5pm, in about the 3rd week of opening, so I personally did not experience the crazy wait times others have mentioned. Buying a line pass on top of an overpriced meal just doesn't float my boat. \nAnyways, on to the good. \nThe BBQ section was on point, and I loved tht they offered lamb. I also remember seeing duck at one section as well. Nice variety. \nThe desserts tasted homemade, although I was disappointed in no soufflé. I had a handmade crepe with fresh made whip cream & strawberries and it was ideal. I also had creme brûlée, and cheesecake lollipops that finished my meal perfectly. \nThis place wasn't bad by anymeans. I'm sure tourist of all over will absolutely love it here.

We put our names into the machines and were quoted a 45 minute wait. 10 minutes later we were called back via text, which was pretty cool. \n\nThe real line took about maybe 15-20 minutes, which wasn't long compared to the wait time we had at the Wicked Spoon on the first day of our trip.

Its $50/person on a weekday dinner.  Thank goodness we didn't have to wait in line too long!\n\nMY FAVORITES:\n-the raw oysters: juicy and flavorful! I expected them to taste plain but they had their distinct oyster taste. The bad part about it is that they always run out, so you have to wait until they shuck more oysters and there's always a line.\n-snow crab legs: always good and taste even better with the hot butter. Most people miss the butter because they didn't know it is in what appears to be a glass beverage jug. A girl even asked me, \"What is that?\" Clearly, it is hot, melted butter!\n-clams, mussels, scallops: the clams were cooked in a really creamy sauce and it was delicious. The mussels were simmered in white wine and tomatoes, but the meat was a bit small. The scallops were still in their shells with spinach, sauce, and bread crumbs (reminded me of an Oyster Rockefeller).\n-fresh juices: near the Mexican station they have jars full of different juices. The guava and Jamaican tea were good! \n-desserts:  the mango gelato was my favorite! The lava cake was moist too.\n\nThey have a very long buffet- seafood, American, soups, Mexican, Italian, Greek, Japanese, Thai, Chinese, desserts. The prime rib was dry and the soups were okay. I'm a soup fan but the chicken noodle soup and the tomato bisque were mediocre. They have a ramen, pho, and udon station too! Three different noodles, three different broths. The ramen noodles were too undercooked and had that flour taste. The pho was better but the broth was super salty. My BF said the sushi was good though. I was amazed at the Chinese station because they had porridge with lots of condiments and ginseng soup! The desserts were so-so. I took a bite of everything and just left it. \n\nOverall, it was okay. I didn't think it was worth $50/person. The only station worth eating here is the seafood station. Our neighboring tables expected the food to taste better too! One table even asked to speak to the manager and head chef to complain about quality and taste...","review_id":"bXsQiCkA0LIxIIhPtDEIQA","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":1,"user_id":"4ZQq0ozRs-gXSz1z55iIDw","date":"2014-09-15"},{"cool":0,"text":"Round 2.

This buffet is simply awesome--they offer so many things that the other buffets don't have! All 3 times I had dinner and all 3 times were very, very satisfying. They have a system now that you can leave your name and number, and the hostess will call you when it's almost time to be seated. But if you're a diamond reward holder--go to the left and skip the line! Yea yeah! I had the privilege to do that once, and it was sweet! Otherwise...expect to wait, but it's well-worth it!\n\n I recommend the hot crab leg station. They take them out from the giant pot while it's still steaming hot. Bring it back to your table and eat it RIGHT AWAY! It's still good when it gets cold, but why go to a hot crab leg station to get cold ones? There's a cold one toward the beginning of the entrance if you prefer that. I also recommend the noodle bar! I know, it's like why waste your stomach on noodles right? But oh my gosh, the broth is amazing! They actually take their time to make it considered I had to go back few times with them telling me to wait while they are cooking the broth. \nI like this buffet very much not only because it offers different cultural cuisines but also because within each cultural cuisines there are so many different styles and options within each cuisine! For example, Asian one has dim sum, hot entrees, stir fry, noodle, soup, and even congee! Italian one has pizza, pasta, charcutteries. Mexican one has nachos, made to order fajitas or tacos, salsa bar, fresh juice that include horchata! American station has prime ribs, chicken and waffles, sliders, etc etc. Seafood station has fresh oysters, shrimps, crab legs, stone crab claws, cooked seabass, seafood boil and oh, even ceviche! \n\nOh yes, save room for dessert!

I will give you my opinions and throw in those of my friends who dined here before.  We arrived at 5 pm on a Wed. evening.  The line was not terrible but was growing.  Wait was probably 15 mins.  Still $50 for a weekday dinner.  Military id gets you seated first.  From the front, the buffet does not look that big...but it does stretch to the back.  You are first impressed with the shucking area (oysters) and crab legs.  I couldn't take my eyes off of it...\nWe were seated towards the middle and drink orders were taken right away.  For a buffet, the service was pretty darn good.  There seemed to be 2 waiters helping us and drinks were refilled and plates cleared quite promptly.  \nWhen it came to the food, I am the type to try a few things and go back for the things that I liked.  So here are my highlights...\n-  Oysters:  just ok.  We had Aquaknox the night before and you couldn't compare it.  But this was the first time I had oysters at a buffet in vegas, so I give them points for even offering.  I didn't try the shooters next to them, but my friends said they were also tasty\n-  Crab legs/shrimps:  This is my vice.  I love crab legs.  I thought in general, the legs were on the small and wimpy side.  With that said, I like the fact that you can get them warmed  (not a given at other buffets).  I also like the drawn butter dispenser.  The shrimp was also really good and they had a nice cocktail sauce to go with it.\n- Meats:  Lots of good looking meat product, all displayed behind a glass wall.  I thought in general, it was very good.  My favorite was the lamb chops.  Very juicy and flavorful.  One of the best lamb chops that I have had (Carnevino was actually my favorite).  The brisket was good, a tad on the sweet side.  Baby back ribs were ok.  I added the BBQ sauce to it.  Every one thought the prime rib was really good as well.  Very satisfied with the meat offering.  I also liked the mac n' cheese that was served next to it.\n- Sliders/Fried Chicken:  The sliders were good.  I didn't fill myself with it, but in any other situation, I would have consumed more.  I thought the friend chicken was really tasty and crispy.  I liked how they served them individually and kept them fresh.  They didn't seem to sit there for more than 5 mins.\n-  Sushi:  Pretty decent for a buffet.  I loved the poke that they served.  Great flavor\n- Asian:  Great asian selection\n- Dessert:  ONe of the best selection that I have been to.  Huge gelato display (espresso was the best) along with Mochi ice cream (haven't seen that before).  The girls loved the macaroons that were served.\n\nI was pretty impressed since this was my first time here.  My friends that have dined here before thought the level had dropped a notch.  I think that is how Vegas buffets go.  When they first open up, service and food are at a peak.  Then as time goes by, things tend to drop.  I just like the fact that most of the items seems to be very fresh.  I would definitely return, just not sure if I would wait 1-2 hrs for this.","review_id":"ntMd3kAcGo5uaqoRGhg4UA","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"pJUzdorsC5BpC3q5ECi4Lg","date":"2013-06-27"},{"cool":0,"text":"One morning while laying in bed with my lovely fiancee, my tummy were making some weird noises.

However, my father had free buffet here, so reluctantly, we headed over here.  Hidden in the back of the casino, you will find this place with a snake line to accommodate large crowds.  Being a Diamond Total Rewards member, we walked right up to the front and got in quickly.  So quick entrance and free meant that my expectations should be exceeded.  And yes indeed it was.  The buffet, like most Vegas buffet was humongous.  But to my shock, the quality of the food appeared to be good.  Appearance was true.  Sushi selection was limited, but they had nigiri so that made me happy.  The prime rib was tender and delicious.  It matched the quality of high end steak places.  The seafood rocked.  How many buffets have raw oysters?  And they were high end raw oysters.  Crab legs and large peeled shrimp added more to my amazement of the high quality food that could be found here.  In fact the food choices were humongous.  I doubt that you could find some you didn't like.  If I had to pay the $50 price tag, I probably wouldn't come back since I wouldn't get my moneys worth.

After waiting for another couple of minutes, we decide to take the express line instead. To be rational, we figured that it would've been the same, in terms of time and cost (15 dollars more + 18% tip per person in the express line) if we waited in the original line. And since there was 8 of us, we figured we would be paying gratuity anyway. \n\nIn comparison, we managed to snag a table for 8, at the peak of lunch buffet on a Sunday, 30-40 minutes earlier than the group that was 30 minutes ahead of us line. \n\nThe selection of food available at Bacchanal was beyond outstanding, and is something that seems to be a response to Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon Buffet and Wynn's Buffet.

Even more than that, I've been waiting to mark my 5 stars and add Bacchanal to my list as the best buffet in Vegas. Unfortunately I didn't get to do any of those. There's not a lot I can say bad about this place. Overall, it was a good experience, but it wasn't the best there is. \n\nFirst of all, I parked in the garage and found it difficult to find once I was inside Caesars. There were no signs to the buffet until you're almost there. We asked four employees along the way. One person didn't have a clue. Once we got there, a long line awaited us. On a positive note, we only had to wait 25 minutes. We got there on a Monday at 10:00. I can't imagine what the wait is like on a weekend. The great thing about getting there after 10 is that they start changing the food line at 11. You get the end of breakfast and the beginning of lunch. Hmmm...I believe that is called brunch. Oh....there is a big price difference between breakfast and lunch. \n\nThe facility is beautiful. It is large enough to walk between tables without disturbing others. Yelpers comment about how expensive it is, but I think it is well worth the money. The food was very good. I was stuffed when I left. For breakfast I had bacon (greasy and fatty), red velvet pancakes (just OK), sweet potato tots (scrumptious), biscuit (OK), scrambled eggs (runny), shrimp and grits (OK). I tasted my partner's french toast and it was very good. \n\nFor lunch I had dim sum (all that I tried was very good), paella (good and an unusual dish for a buffet), BBQ spare ribs (smoky). I didn't bother waiting in line for the very small salad bar. I tasted my partner's very good fried chicken. There were a lot of food choices and the food was a little above average for a buffet. There were no signature dishes that would be unique to Bacchanal such as some of the dishes you will find at the Wicked Spoon. Actually, the way that the food was displayed and served makes you think that the designers spent a lot of time checking out the Wicked Spoon as they were designing this place. Unfortunately, they didn't bring over the chefs.\n\nLastly...the desserts. I only had the red velvet cake and carrot cake. They were both very good. I usually hate the nasty carrot cakes at buffets, but the bakery stepped up to the plate and hit a home run with the carrot cake. My friends had different desserts and said that they were all fabulous. The coffee was good. \n\nI don't like to do buffets because I tend to overeat. I can't imagine that I would ever go back to to this one unless I was with someone that insisted upon going there.

They seated us wayyyyy in the back, like literally having to trek it out to even get to the food. There were plenty of tables closer to the buffet area that needed to be cleaned off. Seemed like they were understaffed.\n\n3. Food. Blah! Yep, I said it. Everything seemed too salty and not much effort put into cooking it. Only thing I really enjoyed were the snow crab legs and their sweet potato tater tots (which were probably frozen to begin with).\n\n4. Pricey. Yes, it's a Vegas buffet, I know. But the quality of the food is not up to par to have it priced \"Vegas style\".\n\nHere's one plus that actually solidifies why my review is staying the way it is:\nOur waiter was hilarious. He had jokes up the culo. We also were really upfront with him and told him the food wasn't all that. So..he also let us in on a little tidbit. Apparently, the old food court at Caesar's that closed down had chefs over there that held seniority. So those crappy food court chefs quite possibly booted out the stellar chefs that first started out here at Bacchanal and that is why the food is crapola today.\n\nMy live review in my YouTube vlog here during that weekend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN4ggfu52w&list=UU5YaBtOxOYqeFEEQ_aW6JiA","review_id":"_bPhuIXPS-xY0DQDOYar3Q","stars":2,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":7,"useful":12,"user_id":"nmqX1cxPOYHwql5e4U9LuA","date":"2014-10-24"},{"cool":3,"text":"Finally my turn to try Bacchanal after months of waiting. Charm C. and I came on a Tuesday afternoon around 3:30. No line at all and we were immediately seated, but before we reached our table our host gave us the mini tour. I swear it really is the little things like that which make a difference. I did the smart thing and walked the entire buffet to look at the options rather than grabbing whatever I saw in sight on my first plate. Stomach space is very important especially for a buffet such as this. The seafood is absolutely amazing, best crab legs, oysters, and shrimp I've ever had from a buffet or maybe even in general. It is true the shrimp are succulent plump yet taste-y. I recommend doing 2 rounds of seafood because you will get your money's worth and it is not filling at all.  My stomach space started to lessen once I started eating the carbs and meat. I was disappointed with the prime rib because it is one of my all time favorites. It was rather dry and did not have a spectacular taste either, but this could possible be because I may have had the last piece. It is true most items here are little pieces of art, a lot of thought went into creating this buffet and you could definitely tell by almost all 500 items. The interior is beautiful, although not fancy I would describe it as elegant yet approachable. So this is the most expensive buffet in Vegas and you could definitely tell by the patrons eating here, the people here are definitely not poor! I don't know if this is worth $50, but if they kept the prices the same as when it first opened they would be getting 5 stars from me. \n\nMust try:\ncrab legs\noysters\nshrimp\nkalbi (great flavor, tender, with the right amount of sauce)\n\nPretty good:\ndim sum\nclam chowder\n\nNeeds improvement:\nprime rib\nsushi","review_id":"FJSPfA1wfei_XbgqeekLXw","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":2,"user_id":"loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA","date":"2013-04-29"},{"cool":3,"text":"Did you ever wonder what food heaven is like?  Come to Bacchanal!\n\nI'm not sure if words can describe how good this buffet is, but all I gotta say it is the best buffet in Vegas. Or in the U.S....or even in the world!\n\nI started down the buffet line with the seafood:\n\nCrab: Long legs filled with sweet meat. Yum!  Don't like it chilled? Have them warm it up for you.\nOysters: Fresh and sweet.  I ate a whole dozen!\nCrab croquettes:  Little crab crakes filled a whole buncha crab meat!\nLobster chowder with corn:  Rich and sweet and you can actually see the lobster!\nKC ribs, sausage:  Meat lovers paradise.  \nTaco station:  I had \"Ariel\" make me 2 al pastor tacos.  OMG, to me, this was probably the best thing at the buffet.  The meat was juicy and crusted on the outside.  I'm drooling as I right this.\nItalian:  Thin crust pizza topped with yummy meat and goooey cheese.  what's there not to love!\nTonkatsu Ramen:  The ramen noodles were al dente and in a sweet and savory broth.  I had two bowls!\nSushi: Didn't touch much of it kuz I didn't want to fill up on the rolls, but there was a big selection.\nAsian: The dim sum was better than most authentic dim sum restaurants I've been to!\n\nIt was hard...but I made sure I saved room for dessert.  All I gotta say is, have the crepes!  And make it a la mode with interesting gelato flavors.  The best was strawberry cheesecake gelato.\n\nI tried to get a picture of the prices because there seems to be some confusion.  But I couldn't find a sign.  I just know I paid $42.99 for Dinner on a Saturday.\n\nI left the buffet satisfied...but sad.  Sad because I couldn't fit anymore food in my tummy.  I spent exactly 2 hours here.

We're not big eaters but decided on our last evening to try this buffet because we had heard a lot about it.  It cost $108 for 2 of us.  There was so much food, and mind you, not great tasting food, just a lot of food.  The key is to arrive early. We checked in about 5:15PM for dinner. They told us it will be jammed by 6PM, it didn't get really crowded until 7PM.  \n\nOur server, Felicity, was really nice and constantly checked back to see if we needed anything.  The only seafood think I liked was the crab legs which tasted pretty good. The oysters on a 1/2 shell, rock crab, shrimp, were all bland. \nThe shooters were OK.\n\nThey gave me an end piece of rib roast and it was dry, even with the au jus, it didn't taste very good. The fried chicken was very cute in a metal basket with a quarter of a waffle but both were dried out tasting.  The fried pork skins were pretty crunchy.  \nI skipped the pastas and pizza area. Had a slice of mortadella, cheese and headed to the Chinese food which was awful.  The oxtail broth was good but everything else - chow mein, shrimp har gow, egg roll, were not good.  Even worse were the sushi - sticky, starchy rice and flavorless.\n\nThe only salvation was dessert which were really good. They even have a sugarfree section. Hubby didn't know he picked up a slice of sugarfree apple pie and said it had an after taste.  The choc cake pop was excellent as well as a slice of the pandan cake.  \n\nHubby ate so much,  to get his money's worth and had to go back to the room to lie down.  He said Bacchanal saved us money because he was going to head off to gamble and ended up trying to sleep off the gluttonous meal.  I couldn't believe it when I saw this skinny young adult woman go back and forth to the buffet and ate about 6 plates or more of food. The entertainment of watching humans with bottomless pits is amazing.  The portly woman next to us went back to the dessert table twice, before finishing her 1st selections and came back giggling to her husband who was appalled that she brought back so much dessert.","review_id":"wxKZSSSA1w3fTNJHEBv3eQ","stars":2,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":3,"useful":3,"user_id":"swmrfBnaqU0nyJ3pFBfNgQ","date":"2014-09-01"},{"cool":1,"text":"It was such a great experience!!

I had mainly thanksgiving food since on Thanksgiving day we ate at an Italian place in Ceasars, which was very good actually. Let's see there was turkey, sausage, prime rib, candied yams, glazed carrots,  green beans, mashed potatoes, and more! It was all delicious. My boyfriend also had some of the thanksgiving fare as well as some sliders, pizza and he really enjoyed the brisket.\n\nI was most excited about the freshly steamed crab legs! Yep...I will admit I had two plates. They were delicious! You bring them a clean plate and they will hand you back your plate full of piping hot crab legs! They had little cups of melted butter just off to the side. I also grabbed some lemon wedges and squeezed the lemon on the crab meat before dipping into the butter. Omg heaven!\n\nFor desserts I believe I tried their tiramisu, creme brulle, and a chocolate mousse. My boyfriend had a raspberry dessert, a piece of tropical cake and I believe something chocolate...he always gets something chocolate.

When we got there after an 1 or so of waiting on line. The host seating us said to ask for the Stone Crabs it's in the back. She also said we can customize what we wanted to eat if they have the ingredients to make it. \n\nGot in, didn't see the Stone Crabs on display & asked the chefs from behind they said NO they don't have. Asked do you not have it for today only? He said they don't serve it. ?? Confused and upset now. When I called & asked, everyone said they have it & serve it. Asked the chef he said NO & there was none on the buffet line. SIGH\n\nWent to the sushi area asked the sushi chef if he can make me a salmon, tuna, avocado with crab meat roll. He said NO. whatever is on the buffet line display. I told him thought you guys can customize stuff if you have the ingredients. He just said NO again and went back making whatever he was making. Annoyed & upset again.\n\nWhile waiting on line saw these dessert on the screen display and when I got to the dessert area most the stuff on the screen display outside was not there. FALSE Advertisement. HUGE LET DOWN. Also they say there is over 500+ items there was not that many unless your counting all the damn hot sauces & toppings. sigh.\n\nAlso they ran out of crème brûlée, waited a very long time, walked in circles too see when there going to get more & finally saw they had a cart there just sitting there. I told the dessert chef that it's behind her & can she just make it now cuz I only wanted one. I was waiting for about 10 mins for it. She said NO it not there yet, they're bring up from the restaurant. I pointed to the cart & she said it's the other side's cart & not her area. BULL Sh%t. Cause 5 mins later she walked over to get the crème brûlée tray at the same cart I was telling her. Made me even more annoyed.\n\nThe line to get in was long like always & inside was only about half full. Our waiter was on top of his game but when he went on break. The waitress was kind of slow. It took us about 15 mins to find her & asked to refill our drinks. But she apologized because 1 of the kitchen was a hot mess & she needed to go to a much further one. When our regular waiter came back our glasses was always full. Then bus boys came out & started to get the dishes off our table.\n\nThe Food Overall was OK nothing that I will remember & crave for it.  But the oysters are small which I like but I didn't like the fact that they didn't clean it so good. A lot of them had sand/ dirt in them. I was scared that I can chip a tooth or something.\n\nDesserts should always be the best part but it wasn't.","review_id":"CdFkZFCDtm6sWOcRL4r7Lw","stars":2,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":4,"useful":4,"user_id":"ZzC-ngWslLIw2hZbWFs3VQ","date":"2012-09-26"},{"cool":2,"text":"An explosion of live cooking stations (including a fresh Ramen station, yes!), a huge variety of great food you don't see at other buffets, a relaxed atmosphere that almost feels like you're eating in your living room (if your living room happens to be enormous)... Caesars set out to redefine the game with their new, $10 million Bacchanal Buffet, and they pulled it off. This is the best buffet in Las Vegas.\n\nMy friend and I were seated near the Asian food, and we loaded up our first plates with Dim Sum style Chinese specialties, Ramen, and Sushi. I moved on next to the Mexican section, which featured absolutely excellent and perfectly moist Carnitas. The Pizza was great as well, with excellent and diverse toppings that you wouldn't normally expect. Even the cheese and meat board were a cut above the rest. Sliced Prime meats and Oysters were fresh and delicious as well. Fresh squeezed Orange and Carrot Juices served in individual carafes was yet another nice touch.\n\nThe dessert section kept the goodness going, with fresh Ice Creams served in Chocolate dipped cones and a Crepe station. The whole experience was incredibly impressive, and $21 for breakfast was completely reasonable.\n\nI'd read a bunch of hype before I visited The Bacchanal Buffet, but Caesars delivered and then some.

The line went by quickly and we were even offered to have our picture taken at the front of the buffet.  We sure weren't dressed for a nice picture to be taken but we did and then proceeded to order the picture later that evening, what better way to remember a great dinner at an amazing buffet than with a professional picture taken?  \n\nWe were seated in the wood themed seating area towards the back but it had a sense of peace in this area.  I liked that each part of the large restaurant had a theme going on which I can't really describe at this moment in detail but I assure you it certainly feels like a different experience in each part.  Our waitress was very attentive and sweet and though I was freezing where we sat my order of tea, which is not just any old tea by the way, helped bunches.  I love that this buffet goes the extra mile in taking care of guests.  My tea was certainly nothing I would find down the grocery aisle, in my opinion, and it came with my very own sealed itty bitty honey jar.  How sweet and cute is that?  I was amazed just by the tea.  \n\nWe started off from the Asian food section way in the back and worked our way up having a separate plate for the cut in half crab legs of course.  Everything was top notch and what I noticed on the other side of the counter was how well the employees worked together.  Coming from a food & beverage background it says a lot when the back end runs as smoothly as it does on the front end.  From what I saw  it seems that they've got a good team going on as far as who preps the food.   \n\nThe meat section was really crowded but that's where the bottled juices were, I loved these!! I grabbed the guava juice and it tasted just as good as I remember it does, guava juice is hard to come by in Nebraska!! The crab legs were probably my favorite next to the delicious desserts!  The next time I'm here I'd like to try the dessert first just so I have enough room in my stomach to try a piece of almost everything.  It's hard to try every type of food you want to at a buffet because everything looks good and at this buffet it certainly tastes good.  I highly recommend any of the asian dishes, the crab legs, and the Italian.

You wait in line to get in now you have to wait that long just to get meat & seafood for food that is already prepared.

Seemed like Caesars does care about the people's experience once the get inside the restaurant.

Most of the food is typical buffet food which is expected to be just ok because its in fact just a buffet, but at $55 I expect a level of quality higher than the norm. I went to the carver part of the buffet and saw a good selections of meats like prime rib, roast, duck, and rack of lamb. I decided to try the lamb and regretted that decision  immediately.  It was completely inedible and that is not a word I use lightly. The meat had a taste similar to burnt rubber with a similar consistency. The dessert section was really good with a wide selection of gelato various pastries including macaroons and cheese cake pops. \n\nI may of just fell victim to the hype of this place and had a bitter taste in my mouth because of its failure to live up to it or the inedible food that they served,  whatever the reason I could not justify giving it above 2 stars.","review_id":"4Htq_B5xI_nprZ-mmWAYfw","stars":2,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"LS5bB39El2G35zEj1bcVyA","date":"2013-03-10"},{"cool":0,"text":"visited this place on our stay at Caesars back on 1/10/16.\nI'd rate this place a 4 out of 5.

For dinner, $50 bucks gets you an impressive selection of meats and seafood, but no booze. The line can also be insanely long - luckily my buddy had his diamond card and we were immediately ushered in and seated - by the time we finished, the people we originally stood in line with were just finally making their way to pay.

You're supposed to get a text even if you don't get a paper print out. GOOD LUCK getting a text.\n\nI even asked how long the regular wait is without the paper, she said 4-5 hours, and this was at 4:30pm.

My dad was in line so I stood in line and was hoping by the time we're up to the lady who is checking people's paper it would of been 8:13pm. It was 8pm and she was fine letting us in, phew! \n\nThe line is super long, I even went up to the front and asked a guy who was paying how long he waited, and he said 1 hour from the start of the line. \n\nLuckily the line was moving, so after the lady checks you in, you still need to wait in line to pay. After paying, which is $208 bucks for 3 people, super expensive, we had to wait to be seated. \n\nI don't understand wasup with the various lines and how people can go there, no one explained anything to us.

There was a bit of mexican/spanish, but that's about it. Other ethnic food were a light touch here and there. The dessert was ok, not mind blowing. I believe this is on par with Wicked Spoon, though I do like Wicked Spoon more. It was 2 hour wait on Thanksgiving day at around 7:20pm there. \n\nFood quality was good, but the wait is stupid. I even asked the cashier, what if I do not have the paper, she said regardless you need a paper to stand in line. If you don't you can't.

I'm not a buffet junkie but curiosity got me on this one.\n\nIt looks all upscale until you walk towards the food stations in the back.  Even then, it still looks nice.  It's because they seat all the non-families in the lounge-ish area in the front and all the families with children in the back where it's like a wild animal park.  It just so happens that those would be your Chinese families and all the Chinese food is in the back.\n\nSpeaking of Chinese food, that was so impressive.  The roasted pork (cha siu) and roasted duck were better than I've even had at some Chinese delis!  Holy smokes.  I was feeling sick that day so they even had pei dan (century egg) and pork porridge which was made true to self.  Noodle bar with ramen and udon were also good. I didn't get to try the pho but the pho topping bar was getting a bit messy and out of control.\n\nMeat bar overall was satisfying with the rack of lamb and sausage variety being my favorites.  What didn't turn out that great was the prime rib which was overcooked and a bit dry.  \n\nSeafood was a bit hit as well.  The shrimp cocktail was the BEST and if the smell of seafood didn't get to me that quickly, I would eat them while bathing in these puppies.  People were getting plates and plates of the king crab legs and I like how they slice them for you right down the middle (with a table saw?) so that it's easy pickings.\n\nDessert takes some serious manpower because it's probably four stations in itself.  My favorite was the chocolate lava cake because the middle was actually still gooey.  I also liked the gelato bar because it was different and they had unique flavors like brown ale and Thai tea.  Not to mention, the fresh crepes were another favorite.  They make you a simple crepe and you can put your own toppings on it.  Mine had nutella, whipped cream, and berries. \n\nMy husband loved the fresh taco bar because they make it taqueria style and the meat is actually tender.  Salsa bar has a bunch of options too so it feels even more authentic.  As for all the other items, they're starting to do that thing where they portion things out for you which makes it look cute but if you're looking to try everything, even their small portions can be a bit much.","review_id":"NsPxi4tzL83qijpGW-nWQw","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":3,"useful":6,"user_id":"NeXRy1C7PxS7bvIcQ3SymA","date":"2013-01-25"},{"cool":1,"text":"I worked for Caesars for 7+ years and was on property when Lago was the only buffet....the comparison is just like night and day!

Many items are a hit and some aren't.  Lets start with the good ones: Crab legs, HUGE! They do have cold and warm ones, chefs are prepared with them as you come by.  Oysters are a hit, but you have to grab them while you can.  Sorry, NO LOBSTER.. Deceiving since they have a lobster on display near the front.  I had the lamb and ribeye.. AMAZING! We had a debate about how lamb should taste with my group and it was interesting about the smell, taste, tenderness and it hit A+ on all three.  Smelled good because it was cooked correctly, tasted wonderful and leaves you mouth with a sweet taste afterwares (we suspect that it's honey).. and no knife needed which means tender!  The shrimp arent like other places (cocktail), this are man shrimps, big and firm.  I heard good things about ceveiche and it is true.. Very well made.  This is dinner.\n\nDuring brunch: I like the fresh juices they have in the bottles in the front.  I had like 10. Sorry.. I would pass on the melon juice.. very light.  Red velvet pancakes.. OMG.. it's actually perfect the way it is, don't add syrup.  Their burger sliders are a miss.. Very dry.  Asian food: I enjoyed the lobster bistro soup they had, but the dim sum was okay.  I enjoyed the ham crossants they had in the Italian section and the different cheeses they had.  Remember, during brunch, you do get MIMOSAS! It's part of your meal, do take advantage of it..\n\nMany of the misses was from the dessert bar.  Maccarons were not as good, not to mention that they just throw them into a pile and they crack.  They had this cake with a pipet sticking into it as a fushion cake and that was terrible (cake was hard and the fusion didn't go in all the way).  The fresh suflet they have in the oven are very well made.. I like how its very moist and soft (caution, extra hot).  The taramiso shooter glass, it was good (not too sweet).  They have a crepe station, they make it pretty darn good, different berries to choose from with toppings.  The gelato is excellent, they have unique flavors including such \"spicy chocolate, baklava, watermelon mint, caramel delight, etc\"  I thought they were pretty good except for the watermelon mint (weird combination).\n\nReason for me taking one star away, is the service:\nSadly, both times, it has been pretty bad.  First time, our server did not approach us until 20 mins into our meal (dying of thirst from your food!).  Not to mention that I had to wave her over everytime my drink was on empty.  Second time, they sat 5 of us at one of the round tables that was very tight and sadly, we ate very fast so the plates piled up all over the center.  \nThe place gets overwhelmed by the number of guests, but they have not gotten the idea of getting more help.

One of my fave things I had was the corn on the cob. It sounds so simple and random but the flavor and the juiciness... OMG SO GOOD!! I also had a lobster corn bisque/soup which was amazingggg. I really enjoyed everything I ate here. \n\nI also really liked their dessert bar. They have the usual assortment of cakes, pastries, and cute little desserts like the other buffets. They can also make crepes! And they also have sorbets/ice cream as well as different flavors of mochi ice cream. Super soft and yummy! They also have macarons here!! I tried several different flavors and they were just A-OK. Not very consistent in terms of texture. Not as good as the ones at Bouchon Bakery so don't expect too much for the macarons. \n\nOverall beautiful buffet, definitely one of the best in Vegas!

We were seated close to the buffet so we were able to grab a couple small plated items and put them on our table and go back for more.

They only had tropical and by the time we left were completely out.  I am surprised they don't restock, especially at breakfast.  Service was lacking.  Plates were not cleared and drinks not refilled, which wouldn't have been such an issue if they would restock the damn juice.  It was not busy at all.  So we should have been able to get better service.  The dessert section was nothing special.  I hope they put out better desserts with lunch and dinner.  There was crepes, pastries, cookies and candy in jars and gelato.  That was it.  We got some gelato on a small cone on the way out.  I would try again if a friend wanted to go for lunch or dinner.

Now I had heard a lot of hype about this buffet so I went in with very high expectations. It also cost me $55 so I wanted to make sure I got the most bang for my buck here. I was lucky because I had anticipated waiting in a huge line after reading some of the reviews and I did go at 6:00 which is dinnertime but much to my surprise there was no line when I arrived there. There was one couple in front of me so I was seated very quickly. When I left, however, there was a huge line so it looks like I came right before the big dinner rush so my recommendation is to go about 6:00 to avoid lines. Ok so now for the actual review:\n\nI was very overwhelmed by the size of this place. There was so much to take in and when I was being taken to my seat the hostess was giving me the guided tour and telling me about all the different stations. I couldn't decide what to try first. My drink order was taken right away and my drink was also served right away which was great. I made a beeline for the seafood section because I love crab legs for one and also because they had clams my other guilty pleasure. I loaded my plate up with crab legs, clams, and mussels. The crab legs honestly were very mediocre. I have had better crab legs at Red Lobster. The clams and the mussels however were excellent and I went back for seconds on those. The rest of the stations were rather unappealing to me. The food did not look that great. I got more mussels and clams and some bread and cranberry sauce from the American station and whats funny is even though I love the stuff that cranberry sauce was from a can. That was painfully obvious. The stuff tastes great but you expect more from an upscale like buffet. Now for the desserts, the thing that makes the whole buffet worth it. I had flan, creme brulee, some cake, crepes, and some mixed fruit. The dessert was straight up heavenly. I loved every bit of it. They also did a great job of clearing up the plates you were finished at quickly so they did not just sit and pile up on the table. \n\nOverall this place is best for their seafood and desserts.

Grand in both scope and spectacle with ornate glass, open floorplans, and plush seating complimented by a staff of over twelve-dozen overseeing preparation, service, and customer needs my arrival at Bacchanal shortly preceded its 8am opening and greeted first by a cheerful cashier, then by assistant manager Stephanie, my experience commenced; the subsequent three hours adrift in 70+ of the buffet's offerings and a sea of smiles emanating from each employee and nearly every patron.  Divided into several sections with many offering cooked-to-order options including crepes and omelets it was Asian that my meal began and with fresh steamer baskets just opened the dim sum excelled - a small quibble in the thick-skinned har gow more than compensated by bao, duck and pork as good as that at Jasmine plus full-service congee complete with century egg, not to mention Sin City's best Egg Custard Tart later discovered at the dessert island.  Moving next to things more \"American,\" one is well advised to monitor for items fresh from the kitchen as both the crunchy waffles and well seasoned chicken proved superlative while later tastes of waffle fries and tots fell flat - a fresh buttermilk biscuit, hot seafood preparations, and sliced meats including smoky beef ribs with caramelized crunch all showing far better.  At times a touch liberal in salt with Kung Pao Chicken and Risotto suffering the most, Bacchanal again shines in selections of shellfish, cheese, and charcuterie but with much eating to do and such things widely available elsewhere it was thoroughly in my sweet tooth that I indulged and although I passed up a few cookies plus a duo of sorbet suffice it to say that I nearly ran the gamut; cakes, doughnuts, pies, tarts, and more all justifying the calories with the aforementioned egg custard, pecan pie, cream puff, carrot cake, and citrus 'tiramisu' all warranting special mention along with the lovely pastry team who jovially tended to baking, saucing, arranging, and making crepes at a pace seldom to lull.\n\nSlightly more expensive than Wicked Spoon but making up the difference in complimentary champagne there are things to love about both of Las Vegas' premier all-you-can-eat experiences yet aside from a more expansive gelato case and my predilection to The Cosmopolitan's soundtrack I'd be hard-pressed to ever recommend it over Bacchanal.  Obviously limited by the constraints intrinsic to feeding anywhere from 2500 to 4500 persons in a given day yet defying the odds through a combination of remarkable customer service and striking attention to detail I'm happy to say that Bacchanal lives up to the liberally applied superlatives and although \"Gods\" may require something slightly more refined I'm almost positive they won't find it in such a format for less than $50, especially on Las Vegas Boulevard.","review_id":"HWxtOcawNPwu1YKI9hODlg","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":6,"useful":16,"user_id":"U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA","date":"2014-06-02"},{"cool":0,"text":"Not as good as all the hype!

Oh it's because we want to get the most out of our money! We followed the yelping stars to make our decision with all the Buffett places in Las Vegas, boy were we wrong! \n\nUpon entering there are 4 lines; 2 VIPs, electronic check in and general entry (which was the longest). We arrived at the restaurant by 7:30pm and noticed the sign that said close at 10pm. General entry is not seated right away. We were told to come back at 9pm. Omg! This would only gives us 1hr to indulge in gluttony? So we opted to skip the long line and pay an additional $25ea to bypass everyone else. Spent $170 so with pride we walked passed everyone only to find ourselves in another line to be seated? SMH! There was about 5 groups ahead of us, since we were only 2 I felt we would get inside fairly quickly. Boy was I wrong. All I heard was, \"table for 6\", \"table for 4\", \"table for 3\", \"table for 1\". OMG! Finally after 15min, \"table for 2\". \n\nLighting was very dark. I guess to set the mood of a romantic dinner. But up to this point how can one be so romantic? The only bright light I noticed were the lights on the food counters shining on top of the food! \n\nAnother thing you'll notice is that the tables are packed in and very close to each other. The best seating with space are the booths against the wall. Walking through this is a challenge because you have to change directions every few steps to avoid hitting a chair. You practically zigzag your way to the food. Upon being seated  (8pm) our server wasn't around to take our drink order after 3min we decided it's time to eat! \n\nAs we work our way though the maze if seats and tables it became very obvious to me this place is probably the smallest buffet compared to all the other top hotels which lead to why it was so congested inside the food area. Most if not all of the food is against one wall. There is no clear place where the start of the line begins because all the different types of food is on one counter. Picture it like the longest cafeteria line. Was this how the designer drew this place up? Horrible! \n\nThe beginning of this line starts in china. It looked ok and smelled pretty good but I wasnt going to fill my belly with Panda Express. Btw...I did notice they had chicken feet! Cool! The line was moving slowly but I passed by Ramen bar, Salad bar, Italian Bar, Pizza bar, nacho/taco bar, appetizer bar then that was it! Huh? No way! But wait, there's another line to goto! \"Calgon take me away! Beetle juice beetle juice beetle juice!\" FML! \n\nSo this line is a bit slower than the 1st but from this point I'm expecting the goodies! In this part small treys are displayed like pork belly, Chilean sea bass, salmon, sautéed  vegetables. Then next up is the carving station which had flank steak,  Pork ribs, beef ribs, lamb chops, brisket, sausage and chicken. Finally reached the pot of gold; seafood! Here you'll find the usual but why there's only 1 spot for each I dunno. I think the line would go faster if there was at least two areas for each. Anyways there was crawfish, king crab, stone crab, oysters and shrimp. People flocking incl myself to get a taste of something that is the same in all the other buffets. \n\nI finally get to sit down with my 2 plates of food and luckily my girl beat be back and ordered my drank. Like I said in the last paragraph, food didint taste any different than your typical buffet. So I was pretty disappointed because I was expecting greatness from all the positive reviews from yelp. \n\nFor my 3rd and 4th plate I filled it up with all different types of desserts. I guess when your full of food, dessert isn't so yummy. Once again nothing stood out. Pineapple pena cotta was very sweet, mango pounding was still liquidy, sangria bread pudding tasted like Xmas bread food blah blah blah. \n\nThe time now was 9:50pm. My server hadn't offer to refill my iced tea and my stomach was full from navel to esophagus however my taste buds were left with a unsatisfaction of flavors not received. For the price I paid, ordering mcdonalds would have done same thing but much cheaper of course. \n\nBtw...there wasn't lobster, ribeye or tarot tots like yelp pics. \n\nTo read the beginning of my review check out Caesars place review. \n\nIf not there were yellow flags about entering this place as well as the hassle to get here lol! \n\nThanks!","review_id":"265x9REz7HWvoWPxrBcLcA","stars":1,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"8wfyiMvIRALmje2hAXv9Qg","date":"2015-08-12"},{"cool":3,"text":"They always say: \"don't eat the sushi at a buffet\" \n\nI was very skeptical going to this place because generally I'm anti-buffet.

When we were in Vegas last year, I had just missed the opening and this year I just missed the one year anniversary celebration, and the Yelp event to boot.  But I finally got to try the famed buffet that everyone else is raving about.  One thing that worked in our favor was that we were staying at Caesar's on this trip and so after checking in and dropping our bags off in the room, we immediately turned around and headed straight downstairs to the buffet.  We were anticipating a huge line but to our surprise we walked right in at around 515pm.  I realize that this is not typical because the line to get in was super long by the time we were finished.  You can purchase a voucher that is akin to using a toll road in LA to avoid the wait, but you'll have to decide whether the extra $15 is worth your time.  Using our Caesar's Total Rewards card for a slight discount, Bacchanal's price on a Fri night was still a whopping $50 per person...\n\nBoasting  of a menu of over 500 items, the $17 million  buffet pushes the envelope for LV buffet dining rivaling Wicked Spoon for current dominance.  They recently had their 1 millionth customer this last LDW and promptly gifted her a two day stay at Caesars w/spa treatment at QUA and unlimited buffet during the stay!  Doing the math, that works out to a mind boggling 3000 to 3500 people per day on the average.  Just another reason why they were voted the #1 buffet in Vegas by USA Today...\n\nSplit into 7 or so separate food themed areas, I was particularly impressed by the Asian section.  Everything is good, but nothing is the best you've ever had quality.  Still, the selection is dizzying,  and there are items that you don't always see at a buffet.  The rice porridge section was surprisingly ok and had all the fixings as well.  I read that they offered tonkotsu pork ramen at some point but they didn't have any that evening...\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=T1MSMPa-rJ4GoKkwTclsWg#T1MSMPa-rJ4GoKkwTclsWg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=T1MSMPa-rJ4GoKkwTclsWg#bvP0vUR6sWwT49KY_qdk-g\n\nThe carving station is a must try at any buffet, but my jaw dropped a couple of inches when I saw the long bone tomahawk ribeyes waiting to be plundered http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=T1MSMPa-rJ4GoKkwTclsWg#qYw8pfJcXqVMccWZ9G46gw.  It's too bad I was in such a state of shock seeing about a dozen of them lying there otherwise I wish I had the balls to ask for a whole one, bone and all after all what can they say:  no?  As it was I was very pleased with the the outer ribeye cap that they had sliced off of one of them for me as it is the best part of the cut imho...\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=T1MSMPa-rJ4GoKkwTclsWg#M22z-WrpCtwH6p8Ce12LUQ\n\nThe dessert section was actually not as big as some buffets but still had a nice sampling of items.  I was drawn to the mochi ice cream but like I said before they're not the best that I've ever had (Mikawaya in Jtown, LA...)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=T1MSMPa-rJ4GoKkwTclsWg#KDUuYNSlPAX989mnJ_cDgg\n\nThe service was very attentive down to the small details like replacing silverware and refilling our beverages when they were half empty.  I never even saw them actually doing the work because they silently did all their magic each time I got up and helped myself to another plate...\n\nAfter about a dozen trips back and forth between my seat and the buffet line (it seemed ridiculous to over stuff and pile on your plate at an AYCE) we finally threw in the proverbial white towel and vowed to ourselves that we would be back during another trip to try more...\n\nEasily one of the two or three best LV buffets in most peoples minds, the missus actually said that she preferred the Wicked Spoon over Bacchanal, whereas I was the opposite and gave this place the slight nod.  It doesn't really matter as both are terrific, you'll just have to try both of them...","review_id":"-Aygdjibdox7l2RT6JPVeQ","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":3,"useful":5,"user_id":"LP59kBNEHmASJZWynra29g","date":"2013-09-24"},{"cool":25,"text":"I had it all planned out.

I ate plenty. \n\nStarting from the far end, there's the chinese section (WALNUT SHRIMP was my fave). They have chowmein, fried rice, eggrolls, stir fry, some dim sum dishes, spicy eggplant, yummy greenbeans.\nThey have Pho, Japo station sucked. Miso soup, sushi rolls.

We go to Vegas often enough and we still always splurge on a buffet or two (or three :p). The way to happiness will always be through your stomach! Bacchanal Buffet makes my stomach happy. The wait isn't too bad the day that we went, I believe it was for brunch. I read a lot of reviews beforehand so I was ready to face a parade of hangry starving people, nope. We even had the whole VIP thing where you check in and they give you a buzzer when your table is ready- just in case. Decent line that moved quickly. The staff were all professional, fast, and efficient. Whatever it is that your mouth desires, Bacchanal Buffet most likely serves it. Shoot, there were things I didn't even know my stomach needed until I saw it. Everything was scrumptious and looked appetizing. From the pastas, meats, SEAFOOD, soups... they all TASTED AMAAZZZIINGG. I was completely stuffed but this was MAN VS FOOD and I was not going to be beaten. 15lbs heavier I walked slowly (breathing heavily*) to the dessert station. Ohmysweetbabyjesus, the variety! I had to get assistance with carrying an extra plate so I could stay seated and sample each dessert that looked appealing (which was almost everything). The sweets were just perfect, I loved that nothing was too overwhelming. OH! The juice. That was some damn good fresh juice they had, YOU MUST TRY. Get fat, splurge. You don't do it often enough!","review_id":"gzfyucas3VUh83cHFkxhWg","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":1,"user_id":"mjwCV-I5rMxIZ5y6PNwO1w","date":"2016-03-01"},{"cool":1,"text":"Pretty effing epic buffet. Only one star off for the wait. And boy, is there a wait. Started the line around 2pm on a Saturday. Figured the lunch rush would be over. Wrong. 1.5 hours later, we were seated. But man, SO much choice. SO much quality. From dim sum, to shellfish, crab legs, prime rib, burgers, truffled polenta, cute beet and mozzarella/tomato salads galore, it's everything you could want and more. The dessert buffet itself is pretty epic. Mochi ice-creams, gelatos, cakes, macarons, pies, tarts, cake pops, and these epic peanut butter cookies that my friends kept raving about. My favorite of course was the seafood legs. I pretty much filled up on oyster shooters, king crab legs, clam bakes (SO CUTE and SO TASTY), lobsters and leeks, and mussels. The dim sum was also surprisingly quality. As a Californian, I'm pretty picky about dim sum, but this pasts muster. Very good. The truffled polenta was a surprising treat as well. As for dessert, the mint and watermelon sorbet was incredibly refreshing. Would definitely hit up again when I come back to Vegas.

Maybe our expectations were set too high because of all the rave reviews and thinking that for $50 a person, this better be worth it. IT'S NOT!\n\n** Side note ** \nThere is an EXPRESS LINE to beat the wait for $15 extra!!!  \n(my advice, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!) The wait was not that bad.. it was long, but it was moving at a steady pace. \n\nThe ambiance and decor of Bacchanal is definitely worth the millions of dollars spent. I dig the seating areas and fancy lighting. Maybe its just me, but I NOTICED each ethnic food station (Japanese, Mexican, etc) are actual Chefs from that ethnic background. Kudos! No offense. There's places that have Mexicans cooking Asian food and call it \"authentic.\"\n\nFood quality was okay. Majority of the food selections I grabbed were room temperature to cold. My ramen soup was bland. I want my food \"hot off the press,\"  you know HOT/STEAMY/SIZZLY.  The Snow crab legs were not juicy enough, possibly because the chef steamed and boiled the juice out of it! So dry! Even the rib eye at the meat station were cooked too dry. We tried to get a side of Au Jus sauce, but the sauce was also bland. Sigh. \n\nWe got our money's worth by taking the rib eye bone home!! Since we could not enjoy it, we thought our dog would sure love it. Why waste it?! Hahah (see picture). Yeah like that!!! \n\nOn to the dessert station, LOVE LOVE LOVE that they offer the greatest dessert fad, Macaroons, and everyone's favorite Japanese ice cream MOCHI. \n\nI suggest trying Bacchanal for the 1st time to say you've eaten here (especially for tourists), but to come back repeatedly? then that's up to you. \n\nI still think M buffet, Bellagio, and Wicked is better hands down!","review_id":"YWF3jPvHONing8BFmNTxNw","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":6,"useful":10,"user_id":"8NPnK5h5Te91Ot6nbX9a5g","date":"2012-12-20"},{"cool":4,"text":"All I really remember about this buffet was standing in line. \n\nStanding in line for seating. We spent the extra $15 for the express line. Was it worth it? Yes...during peak times. It probably saved us an hour. \n\nStanding in line for the food. The way that the buffet is built requires everyone to stand in lines to get to any of the popular food stations. It was a nightmare, but probably also a strategy by the designers to get every one filled up on the cheap food. Because guess what is at the end of the line? The most expensive food...crab legs, clams, oysters and shrimp. By the time we actually got back to our seats with the food, most of it was cold. Eek. But the best way to get through the lines is to pair up and have one person hold a place in the line while the other person puts the plates full of food on the table. Repeat. \n\nThe food: Prime rib and lamb chops were dry, clam chowder was super salty, sweet potato tater tots were delish, kobe sliders were ok, crab legs were ok, shrimp was huge and fresh and everything else wasn't too memorable. \n\nBut...since I paid $65 for this buffet, I was going to get the most bang for my buck. The oysters! My friends and I originally grabbed a bunch of oysters in the shell, but then realized we would get the most out of the oysters shots, which are at the very end of the buffet line. We didn't even have to wait in line, we just kept grabbing the oysters shots from the counter. We poured the extra tomato juice out and just kept eating. Needless to say...a delicious overdose of raw oysters. =P\n\nFor dessert I really liked the macarons, the creme brulee, the watermelon mint sorbet (so refreshingly clean), and the fig gelato were delish. Also, they serve FRESH squeezed orange juice and watermelon juice here. Just ask the waiter. Loved. \n\nOverall, there are some high points, but I consider this place average when there are competing buffets in the vicinity with less lines, lower prices, and more unique dishes.","review_id":"ayom7-YxyrXKsiWOwKLRMA","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":3,"useful":7,"user_id":"ZjTzwlXBbg6-I4vtXTLHHQ","date":"2012-12-28"},{"cool":0,"text":"An amazing selection of gourmet foods.

There were also king crab legs, which I found a bit dry and stringy. The shrimp were very large, plump and tasty. Italian food was nothing special. The waitress said the pasta was homemade -- you could choose ingredients to have tossed with the pasta, but the pasta did NOT appear homemade. Lasagna was so-so. The Chinese offerings had nothing particularly special. We did enjoy the prime rib - nice and rare. The lamb chops were overdone. There was an \"all you can drink\" option for wine and beer extra charge. Service was very good! Drinks were filled, and plates were cleared promptly. This buffet was a little nicer than others, but for me the quality didn't warrant the very high price.

You could break apart the meat with your fork with little effort. This one of my favorite things.\n\n- Eggs Benedict with skirt steak: A small individual portion served in a cast iron skillet. The egg yolk was calling my name from across the restaurant. I ate two without any effort, but had to contain myself before going back for a third. They also have this same dish with fried chicken instead. I wanted beef. The meat is tender and has that nice grilled flavor. Break the egg and it's like a slop of heaven soaking into your bottom piece of English muffin.\n\nQuail egg flatbread: This came lathered with small little over-medium eggs and bacon. The outer crust was crispy and you heard that crunch when you broke it apart or took a bite. It definitely had that wood-brick oven taste, though, I'm not sure how it was cooked. \n\nI am just going to say that you HAVE to eat here at least once.

Bacchanal actually has ambiance and a lot of fru fru.....for two people we paid $131 including a $10 pre-tip that I gave at the register BEFORE being seated. I wanted to make sure that we got some attention. Buffets are predominantly self-serve, but I do like my drinks and napkins brought to me with a smile. And my beverages re-filled like johnny on the spot. Anywho....the wait was finally over. As we were lead to our table, there were plenty of ooohs and aahs as we passed by the various stations and spreads because we were about to get down up in here! Sadly, the food was a bit disappointing. Overall the quality of the food was outstanding (for a buffet). But some of it was just tasteless. However, this is the Ballers' Buffet so when you are on vacation in Vegas, ya gotta do it!  If you've never had exotic cuisine to hit your palate, you will find some interesting things to sample here. The presentation is eye popping. And I watched the \"Chefs\" make the sushi rolls fresh in house.....However this is not the best spot for vegans...you will be stuck eating guess what??? A salad or noodles and rice from the Asian station.  Vegetarians and Pescatarians you are GOOD! I just so happen to eat Tuna and Salmon on occasion...so I found a few things here. The salmon was very fresh and of high quality. The \"Chefs\" even made me some without the heavy sauces. Now, I read about the fresh juices in other reviews BUT the ones on the Buffet are not the fresh ones to enjoy. After having the Tamarind juice on the buffet, I inquired. NOTE: It's always good to talk to the people handling the food because most of the time they know EVERYTHING you need to stay away from. ALL of the juices on the buffet are a concentrate from a plastic jug with water added....yuck! Loaded with enough sugar to send you into a diabetic coma. There is a \"hidden stash\" of actual fresh squeezed juices, that you have to REQUEST. However; there is nothing indicating that you must ask. I immediately guzzled two fresh cucumber juices to calm my system down from the shock of the other crap. To wrap this all up in a pretty little bow, my Partner is a meat-eater and was not impressed. I have a palate for good food and overall, I was not impressed. We were not impressed with the value. It was not worth the price. A whole lot of pomp and circumstance, failure on the execution. Service was good. It is definitely a spot for people who have never had better food, and want to ball out of control while on vacation. If your usual intake is McDonald's, Hamburger Helper and/or Olive Garden, then you will be impressed and delightfully satisfied.

There aren't good lanes and walkways to get to the buffet stations.  Additionally, the stations are broken into different sections in even different rooms in some cases.  As a result, this design leads to confusion and adds to the long wait lines at each station. \n\nMy favorites for the evening were the meatballs, prime rib, rib eye, lamb chop, and mochi ice cream.  The dishes that were less successful were the oysters and sushi.  In fact, my oysters were gritty and I had a hard piece of shell in one of my bites.  I don't think that they did a good job of cleaning the ones I ate.  The food was good and certainly the highlight of my experience.\n\nOverall I wasn't impressed with all of the hype.  I personally had higher expectations for the buffet that is rated as the best that Las Vegas has to offer.  My perspective would be completely different had their not been a hour wait to get in, lines at nearly every station, and the highest priced buffet on the strip.  It amazes me that this buffet can command $50 a person and be this high in demand.  Nonetheless, it's working for them... at the moment.  I doubt I'll ever come back.  I'm a fan of Wicked Spoon instead.","review_id":"5hRHPq-Y43RETOR0tCTAVw","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"qrOXWSK-bpf24dLWnTx29Q","date":"2013-01-06"},{"cool":4,"text":"I almost feel like my review can't be considered complete because I was only able to try about half of all that Bacchanal has to offer - this buffet is huge! \nPark in the Caesar's Palace parking garage, follow Gordon Ramsey's restaurant to your right (don't go into the forum shops) and walk through the walkway by the alcohol slushie shop. You'll pass the huge Caesar statue and the entrance to the pool and will end up right in front of Bacchanal! Yes a shortcut to get you in line sooner, because yes, there will be a line! We showed up at 3:45PM this last time around and there was no line (dinner starts at 3PM). If you're feeling lucky, show up a couple of hours before dinner start time so that you get the lunch price, but dinner options. Be warned, the line can get line so don't cut it too close! \nTheir website boasts about their chicken and waffles, but I thought there were so many other better things. Crab legs and shrimp were good, oysters not so much. The cold legs were better than the hot ones. My meal consisted mostly of crab, shrimp, pork belly and sweet potato balls. The street tacos are made to order and are pretty good. \nThe yuzu mousse, rum raisin bread pudding lemon gelato and chocolate covered strawberries were my favorite. \nShow up extremely hungry, but also not so hungry that you'll be hangry while waiting in line. Anyone that frequents Vegas buffets will tell you Bacchanal is the best, but there is always the conversation of it being worth the price that follows. If you're a big eater, splurge and eat some better quality buffet food at Bacchanal. If you're not a big eater, spend the same amount of money at a nice restaurant instead. It's fun to go to, but I would also hate to eat here and have plans to go clubbing after if I were a local.

Yes, that's a bold statement. They have a huge variety of all the food I love to eat. Seafood is plentiful and fresh(-ish). They had really interesting food stations compared to other buffets. Instead of a generic \"Asian\" section they had separate sushi vs dim sum section and a make your own ramen section. They had the typical meat station with rotisserie chicken and prime rib, and on top of that they had a really aggressive street taco guy. He tried really hard to get me to take 3 tacos, but I looked him in the eye and he finally gave me one. \n\nHere's a weird thing about the bread. The bread display looked suspiciously like the bread display at Guy Savoy. Could they have the same baker? I hope not. \n\nThe only thing I was truly disappointed in was the dessert bar. Nothing was particularly good, and nothing set it apart from other dessert bars. Some of the pastries were mediocre. They have scoop serve gelato, which is a step above an ice cream machine I guess. \n\nThe only thing(s) horrible about the buffet is the wait. I call BS on the pager system.

The cost for B of B is $60 during the week and $75 on weekends (upgraded to \"gourmet\" level).     \n\nDAY 1 (dinner) I hopped across all 6 buffets sampling all the appetizers & finished-off the night with massive amounts of meat until full.   DAY 2 (brunch) I visited 4 buffets, once again sampling different breakfast foods.  DAY 2 (dinner) I visited 3 buffets, but focused most of my attention on the best one (Caesars).  The B of B ticket expired at 6:10 pm but I was able to sneak-in at 6:05 and then stayed in the buffet until 10pm, stuffing myself.   ;-)\n\n\n- Harrahs - below average quality; no surprise there because so too is the casino\n- Flamingo - below average\n- Rio - good not great; don't waste your money on the \"seafood upgrade\" as it's not worth the cost\n- Paris - above average.   I especially liked the décor that looks like a French village plus I love French food!  A lot of people rave about the crepes so I tried 4 of them :-)    BTW paris has reservations on open table.... make sure you schedule a time as it will eliminate 1 hour of wait time.\n- Planet Hollywood - above average (same head chef) but with double the stations\n\n- CAESARS - GOURMET LEVEL.  \n\nThis buffet is not \"free\" like the others but it is reduced to 50% of normal cost.  The food here is almost as good as food found in a high-end restaurant (but not quite).  They have multiple stations serving different cuisines from around the world.

Well, I do, but I just have no self control so I never go :P I really, REALLY wanted to try unlimited crab legs so I begged my boyfie for a few weeks straight to come here and he FINALLY caved over the weekend #winning. We came around 1:30pm on Saturday and the line was RIDICULOUS. Fortunately, we were able to go through a special line so our wait was less than 5 mins. \n\nThe variety of food here is just AMAZING. They have EVERYTHING. I'm not going to lie, I only had crab legs, pho soup, and creme brûlée, but I really did want to try everything else. It's ok though because I definitely ate my monies worth in crab legs (seriously like 7 plates worth between the 2 of us)... they have chilled crabs in the seafood section, but also serve steamed crab legs in the Italian section. I'd recommend trying both because they were both so delicious. Oysters didn't come out until after 3 or 4 (yes, we were there for that long LOL).\n\nIt's a bit pricy, but for the quality of food you get it's TOTALLY worth it.

Luckily my BF has gone several time so I just followed his weaving path through the casino.\n\nTo check-in they have these kiosks to put you on a virtual waitlist that will text you when your table is ready. $20 if you want express waitlist. I would never pay that but my BF was contemplating it. Though the 1st time I went with my BF, the kiosk said the wait was an hour. 10min later, he got a text saying our table was ready so not sure how accurate the waiting estimate is (and good thing we didn't spend the extra $20!). If you're with a group of 6+, go line up in the large group line in the back. So much shorter! They will not seat you though until the entire party is present.\n\nMimosas are included at brunch. There's usually hardly anY orange flavor to them for me so I usually order a glass of OJ to pour in.\n\nLove the Aqua Fresca that they have. Some flavors I've seen were Watermelon, Tamarind, Horchata, Guava (can't remember the rest). My favorite are the Horchata and the Watermelon. So good!!\n\nThe taco station is good and pretty cool to watch the chef making the tacos on the rotating griddle.\n\nThe dim sum they had during Lunar New Year's surprisingly isn't half bad for a buffet. Tried the Shrimp Dumplings (har gow), Shrimp and Pork Dumplings (shu mai), and Soup Dumplings (XLB). I've had worse at actual restaurants!\n\nLove the Stone Crab Claws and Chilled Shrimp. The Stone Crab Claws are partially cut for easier cracking but I usually still ask for a crab cracker to get all the meat from them. The Snow Crab Legs are pretty decent if you pick out the good meaty pieces. They're already split for you for easy eating. Tried the Lobster Benedict but couldn't taste or see any lobster, so if you just wanted an Eggs Benedict, it would be pretty good.\n\nThe nigiri and sushi rolls tasted alright. At least the nigiri didn't look questionable where you'd worry about getting food poisoning.\n\nThe Chicken & Waffles in a Basket was very cute but super dry and salty. Another time, they had Spicy Chicken & Fries in a Waffle Cone that was really tender but was too spicy for me. BF liked the spiciness but thought it was too salty.\n\nLots of cheese & dried fruits at the cheese station. I usually grab a few pieces of Brie and Dried Apricots to nibble on.\n\nNice salad bar with non-wilted looking greens and a good amount of salad topping options.\n\nThe Pork Belly on Lentils was very salty, dry, and mostly fat. The ramen was very mediocre and no body at the table finished theirs. The Chinese Poorridge (jook) faired a bit better.\n\nSaw that they serve Boba next to the Gelato station but didn't look too appetizing. The cake desserts always looks so pretty but have been generally pretty dry. Love getting the gelato and adding the roasted hazelnut bits on top. Tried the Habanero Mango, Melon, Black Sesame, Green Tea Mint, and Pistachio. Liked all but the Green Tea Mint (was just too weird of a flavor combination even though I love both flavors individually).\n\nServers are pretty good aT refilling drinks and clearing the table even though the buffet's almost always packed, so tip them well!\n\nI haven't tried all the Vegas buffets, but of the ones I've tried thus far.. this one is definitely the top one!

Almost EVERYTHING was delicious...well seasoned and flavorful. I highly recommend the lamb chops and the seafood station (crab legs YES PLEASE!). The desserts are also nice and one of the few buffets that actually offer mochi, as well as cute cake pops. Desserts are also not cloyingly sweet, and it cools off the palate comfortably, rather than a shock of sugar. Macarons (blueberry, pistachio, coffee, and orange) are flavored from the filling; the outside shell is all the same almond flavor, just colored differently so do note that. \n\nThings I don't recommend, since some things are not as awesome (understandably so, as there is a LOT of stuff to eat). I would not get the sushi, as it is mostly rice and not much else. The seaweed has an overly fishy taste to it, and some of the sides were not that great (guacamole is only meh). Of course, these are all rather minor, and rest assured that the main stars of the show are all as delicious as they look (meats and seafood). Dessert-wise, everything was pretty decent, but I did not like the custard cups (one is passionfruit and the other is some blue-purple cup-boysenberry or blackberry?) and some of the ice creams seemed a bit diluted (thai tea had barely any flavor). \n\nIf I were to go again--rather, if I want to bust my pants again (6 plates, 4 dessert this time), I would attempt to binge less on desserts and load up on more seafood.

It's basically vegetables with pasta on top, but it was so delicious!\n\n- Carbonara: Pasta was great. It wasn't overcooked and it wasn't salty.\n\n- Chicken tacos: I had these with guacamole, onions, lime, & cilantro, and I LOOOOVE these tacos! You can really taste the freshness of the vegetables and the authenticity of the tacos.

Unfortunately, the group orgy is not available as an option at this buffet.\n\nThe Bacchanal does truly live up to its name, and is only what I could describe as an orgy of food.  If you want a variety of foods, this is the place to go to.  The meat station is probably the best in terms of different offerings - ribs, slab bacon, brisket, multitudes of sausages (ask for it by the inch). There is also a juice bar, that has fresh juices all individually set out in mini carafes. Don't get the green stuff, and watermelon juice is not as good as it sounds.\n\nThe buffet style is somewhere in between Wynn/Bellagio and the Wicked Spoon.  The quality of the food is pretty good for so many offerings.  \n\nIs it worth the price?  Probably not, unless you are a massive glutton like me.  For around $50 per person you could probably get a better meal at any of the other Caesars establishments and get just as full.  But that is not the reason why we go to these buffets. I think of it as a form of entertainment for the eyes...like a strip club for my appetite, but here I can touch.  The dessert station is a bit weak compared to the level of the buffet, but I rarely make it to that point anyway.\n\nExpect a massive line like you would see at Disneyland.  If you have Platinum, Diamond, or 7 Stars membership in Caesar's Total Rewards Club, then your wait is nil.","review_id":"eRHjHTISB1yVupk8ilzH1A","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":7,"useful":5,"user_id":"4q1GOTm23q-qG3o5Kpz81Q","date":"2013-12-05"},{"cool":1,"text":"So far my favorite buffet here in Las Vegas!

I had some of the sashimi which I should have skipped.  I waited In line for the Crab Legs which were cut in half and very tasty.  Sweet and delicious and even better with the clarified butter they have.  \n   At the switch to dinner I waited again for oysters.  I got 6 as I was excited to enjoy some oysters.  One small bite and my oyster craving was over.  The were gritty and disgusting.  Flipped the shells over and waited for the plate to disappear.  I also got a piece of prime rib.  Another regret as it was over cooked and basically leather.  What a terrible crime!  \n   The desserts were all pretty good so that helped soothe the disappointing dinner adds.  The Wait staff was very good and keep our drinks full and cleared plates regularly.  \n   So my verdict - lunch is the way to go if you come to the Bacchanal Buffett.

So was the hand carved ham and kielbasa. The butcher cutting them had a great attitude. He livened up the brunch crowd with his humor and enthusiasm for sure. The bite sized churros I really dug and the slices of bacon were perfect... That was just my first plate. My 2nd plate all seafood everything. Yumm. I had snow crab, king crab legs, stone crab claws and shrimp. All that with lemon and cocktail sauce and I was golden. So good. So fresh and tasty... My next plate was all dessert. That's all I had room for. I couldnt fit any of their great looking sushi, any of the many soups, countless fruit and salad options. It was so much food. I never even made it to the pasta & pizza section. Unreal. So many great choices... My dessert plate was packed with macarons, almond cookies, double chocolate cookies, green tea cookies, pecan tarts and the classic chocolate chip cookie. They were all pretty good for the most part. I had a bite of someone's flan. It was good. The strawberry shortcake was also real good. \n\nService was excellent. We opted for the champagne brunch for our party of 8. You have an option for peach bellinis too. And pretty much any fruit puree/nectar of your choosing. \n\nI highly recommend the Bacchanal buffet.

Not only is quality there, I'm loving the beautiful presentation and excellent customer service.  Last time I came, was a Thursday around 5:30pm and we came right before the rush.  Me and two other people just walked right up to the counter to pay.  Once I turned around there were already about 30 people in line.  Suckers =)\n\nFor around $50 a person it's damn worth it.  I like the organization of the place.  It's divided into different stations.  There is an Asian, Italian, Mexican, Japanese, meats, seafood, and dessert station.

Props to the chefs for everything being so well done and beautifully.  \n\nThey sat us by the impressive dessert bar.  It was literally a bar that wrapped all the way around.  I think I saw at least 3 people video record the desserts walking around it.  LOL.  Kids went crazy over it.  They had all types of cakes, cupcakes, macarons, chocolates, ice cream, chocolate covered goodies, pastries, creme burlee, and candies.  However, my favorite thing at Bacchanel was their seafood station.  Their raw oysters were to die for.  I also loved that the crab was pre-sliced for your ease and they had hot butter to dip.  I'm not huge on meats, but their meat station was very impressive.  They even had lamb chop!  A few of my other favorite items that are worth mentioning are their ravioli in the tin cup, their fishes, and their Asian soups.  I wish I could have been less full so I can try everything.\n\nThe inside is very large.  The tables and chairs are comfortable and it's easy to get around.

So a couple things have changed, such as you have to get here early if you want to try everything!  Example, Chocolate covered strawberries (the size of your fist) come out at about 7pm and are all gone by 8pm. They still make souffles (chocolate, pistachio, or banana) to order, but you have to ask as they don't have them sitting out there readily. They have added mochi ice cream, and they don't replenish the fresh oysters as quickly as before. Also, they don't keep restocking the beet salad. \n\nI got there around 5:30pm on a weekday, and the line was about a 45 minute wait to the end of the waiting line ropes. By the time I got to the front the line looked an hour and a half long, it snaked past the ropes and back to the pool area entrance, eek. \n\nAnyways, the food was still as delicious as ever. The oysters were cold and fresh, the crab legs were sweet (best eaten cold even though they will heat them up for you in a pot of hot water), the prime rib, ribeye, and lamb rack were cooked perfectly medium rare, great variety of charctuerie, delicious version of caprese salad and beet salad with goat cheese. For those asians out there, they have a very nicely done asian soup of black chicken with longon and stuff in the asian section. I saw asians grabbing 2 bowls at a time. They also have those soup dumplings that got famous in new york. Desserts were amazing with macarons, tiramisu, souffle, crepes, lollipop cakes, (didn't get to the chocolate covered strawberries because they ran out), mochi ice cream, gelato and sorbets (give the blood orange sorbet or the thai tea gelato a try). \n\nI kept wanting to eat more but my stomach just was not able to hold everything.

Four...hours...of...hunger.\n\nI have some ideas on why the wait was four hours: 1) Father's Day weekend, 2) Caesar Palace's 50th Anniversary on a weekend, 3) EDC week, 4) Summer vacation, 5) one of the few remaining Las Vegas buffets that serve King Crab legs.\n\nThe process is pretty simple. Go to a kioski, punch in your mobile phone number, go up the food agent (hostess?) and blabber about how long the wait is, leave the area and go shopping/drinking, come back within an hour of your wait, then eat! My cousin had a conspiracy theory (which is her normal state of mind): they want you to roam around, gamble, and spend money while you wait. She may have a point there.\n\nOnce you get in line, there is another line. Sigh. We didn't know you could pay in advance to cut in line, but I don't think they were offering this tempting upgrade due to the heavy amount of people frequenting the buffet the day we went.\n\nThe inside was spacious and clean and hardly any lines! It's ingenious how Bacchanal manages to let people in at staggered times to avoid Buffet Line Road Rage. The only \"line\" of 2-3 people were mostly gathered around the \"King Crab\" legs, which were super anemic-looking. I still have a sneaky suspicion they were Snow Crab Legs...it was still delicious with the warm, nutty clarified butter. We ate so much we felt a little queasy. \n\nI could go on and on about the food but I'm sure the 12,000 photos on Yelp will do the talking. It was worth the wait just so we could say we ate at the Bacchanal, but if you have hungry screaming kids, I'd avoid the Bacchanal during peak times and go elsewhere. \n\nWe paid about $120 for the both of us, not including the tip.","review_id":"85Xz2dVEwvj2fvcnqWzZPQ","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":9,"useful":14,"user_id":"3Z0qWxM8ZCoDLzErwZyaWA","date":"2016-07-03"},{"cool":3,"text":"This is where I ate too much and hated myself after having reached the highest level of fullness that my stomach could handle.

There are international offerings that aren't limited to egg rolls and pizza. The desserts are fantastic with cake pops, a crepe station, and assorted pastries.

For example, I make a plate and bring it back, she takes bites of anything she's interested in, then she goes up to fill a plate while I eat the rest.  It's a great way for us not to waste a bunch of food, and we get to share opinions bite by bite -- then make a second or third trip to get more of what we liked best.\n\nFor me, the best dinner item was the sweet potato tater tots.  The skin is crispy, the inside gooey, and they're glazed with a salty sweet syrup caramelized shell.  So simple, and yet ... amazeballs!  I also high five the staff for their excellent ceviche, chicken marsala, spicy fried fish, and charcuterie.  One slice of ribeye steak was great, but the next was fatty and awful (the flank steak too.)  I was so-so on the lamb, and the other veg choices.\n\nNext time I'll remember to leave LOTS of room for dessert, and FILL UP on watermelon mint sorbet.  Maybe the best dessert ever?  Tho I'm usually gaga for french macaroons and mochi.  But I prefer mochi in mango, which they skipped ... and their macaroons had great shells, but the inner cookie was too moist, and too much filling, too thick.  The center should be like a sweet adhesive only, not a thick band of firm chocolate ganash.  Generally too much sugar in most of the desserts, and tho some say the dinner is overly salty as well, I like salt and thought everything had the right levels.\n\nIf I have guests in town who want the best buffet and can afford a real treat, I would def go back.  :-D","review_id":"jVk5WXzTMx3aujS7OkgPMQ","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":4,"user_id":"Hj2bC9FUrj2NbCn2noproQ","date":"2013-07-24"},{"cool":3,"text":"We came here for lunch and I was kinda hoping for the best because of all the wonderful reviews I read, but I thought it was just OK.

I have to say that this is the best buffet in Vegas.   \n\nThough the buffet is smaller than some of the other top buffets, they make up for it in quality.  Like Wicked Spoon, they offer a la carte portions.  I love that - it's clean, individually portioned, and you get buffet items you'd expect on full restaurant menus.\n\nThey won me over when I saw red velvet pancakes and monte cristo sandwiches for breakfast.  And they surprised me when I saw taiwanese breakfast offerings and pretty solid XLB and hargow dumplings.  My favorite breakfast item was their Croque Madame which had a perfectly over-medium egg in the middle of the sandwich.  My buddy, a tough critic, thought that the eggs benedict was perfect.\n\nFor lunch, loved their shrimp cocktail, their ceviche bar and gaspacho.  They also had a taco bar where they freshly cooked carne asada and al pastor.  And they had a full guac/salsa bar.  It was definitely good.  But the star of the show was their meat station.  They offered prime rib, st louis ribs, and beef brisket.  The ribs were tough and dry - didn't recommend it.  But I requested my brisket extra fatty and the guy behind the counter lit up like my Christmas tree.  He gave me some great burnt ends and it was just some great meat.  I really enjoyed my brisket here.\n\nWhile I love entrees, my heart is always reserved for dessert. They definitely had a few solid offerings.  They have some fancy looking chocolate, they have creme brulee, I really liked their praline tarts, they had a crepe station, and a gelato bar.  My favorite gelato was their baklava gelato.  Pretty solid.  It didn't beat the Thai Tea gelato I had at Wicked Spoon the night before.  And I can't say that the dessert was better than the Bellagio buffet.

Maybe tonight was just an off night, but with the hefty price, I won't bother coming back anytime soon to see if today was just a fluke. \n\nFirst off, I knew of the high price, so that was no problem. I had no qualms about paying for what I expected to be an excellent dining experience. The line may not look too bad, but it moves very slowly. Then after you pay, there's another slow moving line to get seated. (If you're not in the Express line, or a Diamond/Platinum Total Rewards member, expect a long wait during peak times). For dinner, it took an hour and fifteen mins from entering the line to finally being seated. Ambiance and decor were nice inside, but it's all about the food right? (Also, a lot of the walkways between tables are narrow. Just an FYI in case you're larger sized, you may want to request being seated along the edges).\n\nService was pretty good, drinks refilled and server was very much on top of clearing plates away. It was one of the few highlights of the meal.\n\nAgain, maybe tonight was an off night, but everything I tried was so dry and tough or had little flavor. The lamb was not juicy at all, the brisket was so overcooked and dry to the point of being inedible. I took a bite and unfortunately had to leave it unfinished on my plate. Also tried halibut with herbs and fennel, but it was strangely completely flavorless. Tried the wagyu beef slider, but instead of being moist and juicy it was overcooked and dry. The first batch of Korean kalbi short ribs were actually decent, but my second helping was completely chewy and the marinade tasted different than the first time. Many items looked dry and unappetizing. It made it difficult to find items to fill up my plate. Was hoping to try lobster bisque, but only found lobster corn chowder that did not have any lobster to be found. It made up for it in the amount of corn though and was disgustingly sweet that I also had to leave unfinished. \n\nDessert...walked around the area to scope everything out first before diving in. Everything looked pretty but few items jumped out enough to make you want to eat them. Nothing terrible to say about the desserts, but nothing memorable at all either. \n\nVery disappointing. With the 500+ items this buffet touts, I was expecting more. The selection didn't seem anywhere near what this buffet claims. There's nothing worth noting at the buffet that I found to be mouth watering or worth going back for seconds.

Located inside Caesars Palace, this buffet is definitely a sight to see.  We walked in, paid and then around to scope the food options.  I thought it wasn't as big until we saw the back end and more options.  Whoa!!\n\nWe decided to split up our dishes into different types of food.  I went with the breakfast platter to start.  Bacon was on point, the benedicts were delicious, the eggs were solid, and the OJ's were freshly squeezed juice.  What an awesome starter.  Oh they had red velvet pancakes too, my goodness.  Next came the meaty portion.  It was all juicy and tender much to my enjoyment.  The seafood platter was after followed by the dessert plate before we both tapped out.  It was so much food.  I contemplated staying there the whole day but we had some more business to attend to so after dessert was finished it was go time.  I felt their desserts were lacking a bit though but the seafood was really delicious and fresh.  \n\nBacchanal has everything and I mean literally everything.  Vegas buffets always delivers for me.  The options are limited and theres just so much variety.  I likes me a ton of variety.  The food is 4 star quality too so you can't really knock that.

The place was decorated in a very modern fashion, down to the glass cases of king crab, the comfortable chairs and extra-soft napkins, and even the lounge music! I was surprised the wait was so short as well (20 minutes for a 7:30pm dinner). Then again, it was the Monday after Thanksgiving so people were probably still full of turkey. \n\nLooking from the outside, I thought the buffet was going to be fairly small but it turned out to be a massive freaking labyrinth. I was shocked when I walked in. From what I remember, there was an Asian food station, salad, Italian, Mexican, American, MEAT, and SEAFOOD. Dessert is in its own private island in the center of the buffet. \n\nHere's a quick summary/review of what I ate:\n\n-* Lamb chop: AWESOME. My first time having lamb. Perfect and not too cooked or chewy at all.\n- Brisket: Oh. My. Goshh. I can't even. It was as good as my favorite slow-cooked brisket my mom stews at home (and she's the best chef I know).\n- Prime Rib: Pretty good, but I've had better.\n- Sweet Potato Fries: Yummy and sweet but by the time I had been through the lines and got to eat it, it was cold ):\n- Mac and Cheese: Why would I get mac n cheese at a 45-dollar buffet? I was craving it, okay! It was nothing extraordinary though.\n- *String Beans: Tell me...How in the world could string beans taste so good?! I still can't get over it.\n- Lobster Corn Chowder: A little too sweet for me and I couldn't find any pieces of lobster meat in the tiny tray.\n- Pretzel Roll: Cold and too tough. The ONLY thing that I legitimately did not like.\n- *King Crab Legs: Pre-opened, juicy, delicious, sweet, just hnnnng. Dipped in butter, of course. You can get it hot and fresh from the boiler if you give the server your plate.\n- Oyster Shooters: Yummy!\n- Raw Oyster: Small but fresh.\n- Shrimp Cocktail: The shrimp are larger than normal buffet shrimp. I appreciate that.\n-* Creme Brulee: Awesome. The creamy part wasn't too sweet and the sugary top was crisp as should be.\n- Macaroons: This was my first time having macaroons so I don't know if it was supposed to be so sweet, but I definitely felt a tooth-ache after a few bites.\n- *Cupcake: Strawberry Lemon cream...Perfectly smooth, light, and not too sweet. Loved it!\n\n*Favorites\n\nI tried a lot of little desserts but most were similar and I'm not much of a dessert person in the first place. I also tried a lot more food but the ones I listed were most memorable. Also, I basically skipped all the Asian food because I felt like they weren't worth it for the buffet when I could eat something else.\n\nRated four stars instead of 5 because of the price and how long I had to wait in line to get food. If they only served the best half of their dishes and got rid of the duds while lowering the price a bit, I would definitely rate this place a five.\n\nSorry if my review is a bit incoherent. To be honest, the best description I could give you of Bacchanal is the following: SKHLKDHJFLAH HNNG.\n\nThat is all. I will probably come back here for my birthday in a few months.","review_id":"aFDddm7mpvL1c2gzOgvAow","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":2,"useful":3,"user_id":"QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA","date":"2012-11-29"},{"cool":0,"text":"I came here this past weekend after reading some great reviews for this place.

These were all pretty good. They also had some more interesting dishes. Of the breakfast foods, they had huevos rancheros, croque madames, corn beef pizza, steak and eggs red velvet pancakes, and chicken and waffles. Unfortunately most of the breakfast foods were not great, except the chicken was delicious.  \n\nHowever, the lunch and Asian foods were really really good - I'm not talking Chinese buffet quality, but much much better. They had dim sum, and not just spring rolls, but soup dumplings (WOW!), sticky rice (good), and har gau (which I don't eat). The noodle station had amazingly flavored ramen. And the Peking duck was some of the best I've ever had.  \n\nThe charcuterie and salads rocked, especially the prosciutto. Who doesn't love prosciutto.

You could get lost just going from station to station.\n\nIt's got everything all the other buffets have and they even have freshly squeezed juice for lunch. The Texas squeezed orange juice being the best which explains why it runs out so quickly.\n\nThe crab legs weren't spectacular. Possibly because it's pre-cut and iced already. The oyster shooters were good though. Everything else was decent. I didn't get to try all the food here but what I did try, it was good enough. Not all it was hyped up to be but I'd still eat it and enjoy it.\n\nDinner lines do get long. Especially for the meats (prime rib, lamb, etc). Standing in that may be a 10 minute wait in and of itself.\n\nAll in all, it's a good experience but other buffets are comparable and the lines for those are going to be shorter. Go here if you want to hit up a new buffet.","review_id":"DGlULzl8SKjUixXtb9u6BQ","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"enNgSlVFfjDtegqVsVUYKw","date":"2013-03-14"},{"cool":5,"text":"My last review was for dinner, but todays is for lunch.\n\nWay different vibe and experience. A good one at that.\n\nSurprisingly we got there at 12:15pm on a monday and there was hardly a line. 15 minutes at most. Whaaaat?! Awesomeness! \n\nThe hostess sat us (party of 7) at a breathtaking round table. It had its own gorgeous wine chandelier dangling in the middle. I felt as if we were VIP. The chairs were super large, grey and comfy. Didnt give that buffet vibe but that, extreme vintage dining feel. My toddler loved them and actually (for the 1st time ever!) didnt try to climb out of her chair. The world must really be coming to an end i tell you.\n\nThe waiter was quick to get us our drinks, offer a wine list and ask if we had any questions or needed a highchair. \n\nOff to stuff myself, yes i skipped breakfast, I went first for the cheese and meat section. The selection was good, but not as good as the dinner. They were missing brie and a couple other cheese's. Boo. Still, there was a good amount and they were super tasty. On that same plate I added a chicken, cheese and chile tamale. It was warm, juicy and full of flavor. Not to mention huge. Bigger than any tamale I've ever seen. Perfecto. Lastly on my plate I made myself a caesar salad. I noticed they no longer had the pre portioned caesar salad which was sized to fit my needs. no biggie, I made my own. It was very good. It was the first time I noticed that the crutons were fresh and made from.. cornbread? Delish!\n\nPlate #2, had mac n cheese on it. Nothing too special. I guess lately I've been mac and cheese'd out, thanks to my daughter. Next to that was their salmon. Holy moly, it was very good. Not the best salmon, since it was plain. But it was fresh, non fishy, juicy and flakey. Wished it had some sort of buttery or peppery taste. Cant complain too much, when i literally almost licked the spot where the salmon sat. Finally, on that plate I had two tacos. A steak and pork. These were the best items I had at the buffet. The gentlemen made my flour tortillas, and cooked the meat right before my eyes. Then he loaded it. Whats loaded you ask? Cilantro, green sauce and onions. Nom NOM Nom. If you want anything extra (I.e sour cream, salsa, etc, its on the other side) I almost was going to go back for, NO JOKE 4 more but then everyone at the table reminded me that I had dessert still to try. DARN :( Until next time my sweet tacos!\n\nDesserts were good. Didnt see them making any of their souffles. Huge let down. Chocolate strawberrys were tasty and good. Reminded me of how much Ive missed them (HINT hunny, our anniversary is coming up!) Had to try the sticky toffee ice cream. it was okay, tasty but honestly it wasnt as toffee as I expected. I could barely taste it and wouldnt have known it was toffee unless it was in the name. Lastly I had to get a crepe. I missed them my first time here and I wasnt about to leave without one. The lady working the crepe making station was super nice. She chatted with me about my daughter and told me about her's. Its friendliness like that, thats what really makes me come back to a restaurant. She quickly made it, diced up a banana and then put a huge spoonful of whip topping (i asked for extra!) and then drizzled nutella and chocolate all over. It looked spectacular and tasted even more so. it was a big size and I made sure to finish that puppy.\n\nYet again I loved the caesars buffet and cant wait to come back. I'm thinking next time we will come for breakfast! You know, they say third times a charm :)","review_id":"-SQ4VUqA08lpuJ1cBHc3Mw","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":2,"useful":7,"user_id":"WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g","date":"2012-12-11"},{"cool":2,"text":"This buffet has the reputation for being the best on the strip!

And after hearing about the brunch offerings at that event, I knew that it would only be a matter of time before my husband and I would be feasting at Bacchanal Buffet in the morning hours...\n\nThis past weekend we had family in town from back east, and what better way to welcome family to Vegas then to pig out at the best buffet in Vegas. (For what it's worth, that's what USA Today said, not me!). We arrived around 9:30 am and there was only a short line, it took no more then 15 minutes of waiting before we paid and were seated. For those of you that just can NOT wait, there is a line pass you can purchase for $15. \n\nNote: This is not a cheap buffet. It is priced in the same range as the other high end buffets. Brunch was about $45 per person, that includes champagne. There are other, cheaper places to get your grub on but when it comes to buffets you absolutely get what you pay for... \n\nDo not expect everything to be cooked and waiting for you to scoop out a serving, cafeteria style. That's just gross. Bacchanal has employees at all of their stations and while a decent amount of the food is premade, in SMALL batches, other items are prepared for you right then and there. Meaning you get the fresh tasting food at the right temperture, provided you can be a bit patient.. \n\nHighlights of our meal:\n\nRED VELVET PANCAKES. I was super excited to try these and they did not dissapoint in the slightest. The size of the palm of my hand, cooked to perfection and topped with both strawberries AND raspberries. Heavenly.\n\nThe crepe stations. That's right, plural. The lady that made my crepe informed that that Bacchanal has crepe makers working all hours, but for breakfast they have both a sweet AND a savory crepe station. \n\nThe chorizo and papas were tasty. Melon juice was delish. Freshly made-to-order omelette was perfect. \n\nOne thing I knew about Yelp events is that we don't get the same experience as a \"normal\" customer may get, because the employees know they are serving a bunch of hella critical foodies. I actually feel like the service we got during brunch was as food if not better then the \"special\" service we recieved at the grand opening. A pot of coffee was left at the table for us but it was almost always poured by our waiter... My mimosa was being topped off constantly. Extra napkins? No problem. Plates cleared efficently, and all was done with a smile.\n\nAny time we have family in town that want to check out a buffet, we will be taking them to Bacchanal.","review_id":"1nPVU2NNZG5iMIM5PvdRhg","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":5,"user_id":"Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw","date":"2012-10-08"},{"cool":3,"text":"Nothing quite impressed me here although the decor and the sheer size of options of the dessert island to the drink bar was spectacular. Other than that, the 90 minute wait for a $62.00 meal ($125.00 for boyfriend and I after tax) for very average food was underwhelming to say the least. Really be prepared for the insane wait as we lucked out and only managed to wait and hour and half whereas others were waiting much longer times.\n\nI'm not much of a seafood fan so I didn't get to utilize the full benefit of the crab leg section as most people do at a buffet. I ended up trying a little bit of all their meat bar, their artisan sausage was the best in my opinion: It was tender and full of flavor. Their steak piece was on the dry side as well as their prime rib. Although their lamb chops was pretty delicious. Second round went to a series of different things, I managed to eat a heapful of their seaweed salad (bombassdigity!) and I tried some of their Chinese BBQ pork which was impressively very good. Subtle sweetness from the honey on the outer layer with tender meat in the center was how my grandmother makes it at home.\n\nThe boyfriend and friends all had the sushi which was subpar according to them, but they loved the horchata that was available at the drink bar which consisted a cool selection of other juices like mango, guava, and pineapple. I'm not much of a sweets person so I didn't get anything from the dessert section, but the guys loved the gelato (Nutella seemed like the overall winner).\n\nThe service was slow AF though, our plates were rarely collected and so they started to stack on the table which made it difficult to eat on the table and we kept wondering where the staff was when we needed water refills.\n\nLike I stated before, I wasn't impressed, especially for the price I'd think the quality would've been better (felt almost like a standard buffet quality). Would I come again? Probably not, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere, but definitely worth at least one visit if you've never been.","review_id":"P_gnZd_UnTqxnJ7g0A_OcQ","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":4,"user_id":"6nvUppVogRTTwZCgaYCPjw","date":"2016-08-16"},{"cool":0,"text":"Yummy!

It took 30 mins for me to finally make it to the front of the line, but it was worth it. The presentation is fancier than your typical casino buffet (gold coast, the M, orleans, rio). Although be careful, all the fancy/cute ala carte dishes can easily slide off your plate. The chefs are all really enthusiastic & friendly. They try to help you & greet you. The server I had was \"eh.\" All buffet servers really do is get your drinks & take away your plates, so if I needed anything (refills, change), we had to wave him down. This is a huge buffet for seating & good selections. Half-way through their stations I was getting full. Their food is a big hit or miss! It's either yummy & delicious, or blah. I noticed some of my dishes tasted too salty. As for everything else, it's above average! I was intrigued seeing the decor & certain food choices. Desserts have a big selection too & not just \"the usual.\" This buffet is $45 but better than getting a Las Vegas whole day buffet-hopping pass. & that says a lot!","review_id":"spRelaCoOUXd4_6pn-ICtg","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"XqsuWJIwdy0OXYvUX1I2-Q","date":"2012-11-18"},{"cool":4,"text":"Wow! What a shame that this is named the best buffet in Las Vegas! We were only staying on the strip for one night and Caesar's was what we chose for Saturday night dinner.

The best items were by far the carved turkey, mac & cheese, and mashed potatoes & gravy ... but honestly, how would you really mess those up?\n\nWe were highly disappointed by most of the rest of the selections. They had sushi, fresh seafood, Chinese options, meats/cheeses, fried foods, etc. Also, the best part really should've been dessert (I was hoping) but again, we ridiculously disappointed by those!

Came here on a Tuesday night for dinner around 8:45 pm.  A 15 minute wait to the point of being seated; not bad. My appetite was building as I waited in line looking at the raw bar and the crab legs. I didn't get that the last time, because I came for lunch. \n\nWith a bigger crowd than my lunch visit, I got a better feel for the weaknesses of this buffet when it is \"packed\".  The waiter was far less attentive than last time, he was missing the first 15 minutes after we were seated.  I waited to order our drinks and let my fellow diners go get their food.  However, my husband had a meatball accident...and the waiter brought a rag and club soda.  That was nice although it took him about another 15 minutes to get it.\n\nNow about the buffet...\nAgain I love that for the most part they pre-portion food, so it \"grab and move along\".  However, the seafood bar is really not set up correctly.  The condiments and sauces are first, then the plates and then seafood.  People waiting in line (and there is always a line at the seafood bar) get down right angry cause it looks like you are cutting in line, but all you want are your condiments.   So about that seafood; I got oysters this time, and they were good but not great.  I guess I like a different type.  The crab legs....holy SALT! And I like salty, but I guess that is how they stop you from taking more than one plate.  So disappointing.\n\nMeats- Impressed they had lamb chops, but they were, unfortunately, well overdone.  The prime rib was also a medium-well done; i prefer it rarer and asked for a med-rare piece but that was the piece I got.  \n\nMexican- I pick here and there.  Taking they carnitas, hot sauces, salsas and guacamole.\n\nItalian/Pizza/Mediterranean-  I don't eat any starch, but it looked decent.  Hubby said pizza crust was a bit soggy though.\n\nAsian- yeah. I finally made it this far, but none of it was impressive, but it was decent, better than most take out Chinese. Sushi- generic, but like they still offer it. \n\nHonestly, I think my favorite thing was the salad bar and cheese selection.\n\nI actually walked away this time, not stuffing myself. That is a first. Anyway, I STILL think this is the best buffet on the strip, but I think I won't be back unless any out-of-town guest ask to go to a buffet.","review_id":"EXhViG_97yGz6nd_FpR0_g","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":4,"user_id":"ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg","date":"2013-05-13"},{"cool":0,"text":"Give you large amounts of prime rib and brisket.\n\nFresh squeezed juice: tropical, orange, melon, etc.\n\nBuffet with waiter service.\n\nNoodle station with pho and tonkatsu ramen.\n\nSushi, dim sum station, italian food station, mexican food.\n\nLots of unique ice cream flavors.\n\nCreme Brulee was not good consistency.

What you've heard is true. This place is a 5/5. Hubby and I finally got to check this it out. We opted for a weekday breakfast at 10:30a in order to pay the lowest price, have no line to wait in and to enjoy the switch over to lunch at 11a. \n\nBut like any buffet, there are certain parts that amaze and certain parts that fall short. Here's my list of the great and the not so great...\n\nThe great: \n\nBreakfast Tacos - Seriously the best part of breakfast served here and probably the best breakfast item I've ever had at any buffet. The tortillas are freshly made and are almost as legit as Tacos El Gordo. They are topped with a perfectly seasoned over-easy egg and just the right amount of cheese. Now, if you want to take this thing up another level, add a spoon full of their cooked Mexican beef that sits at the same station. It's bursting with tons of flavor and completely made my morning. There's no need to add any salsa, guac or sour cream to this baby because it's doesn't need the help!\n\nChilaquiles - Completely loaded with a the delicious-ness!!!\n\nBBQ Brisket - I believe this wasn't out until lunch time. So this was probably my favorite of the lunch selection. It was very tender and juicy and had a crazy amount of flavor. I was shocked to find BBQ of this quality at a buffet. And I've been to crappy \"BBQ Restaurants\" that don't have Brisket half this good. \n\nMango and Jalapeño Chicken Sausage - Mildly sweet flavor with some heat on the back. Very solid choice. \n\nCreme Brûlée - There's a lot of bad Creme Brûlée out there, especially at buffets. But this place's wasn't just decent, it was awesome!! Definitely some of the best we've had ever!\n\nChinese Egg Tart - I'venever heard of these before, so I have nothing to compare them to. But I sure loved them! I would describe them as a chess Pie with a cream cheese flavor. \n\nChocolate Lava Cake - Now I must confess that I only at the top half that was filled with gooey chocolate goodness. But either way, it was something I went back for quite a few times. \n\nOther Decent Choices\n\nAsian Broccoli Stir Fry\nEgg Rolls\nSushi Cones\nSteak & Eggs (seriously, the most perfectly seasoned over-easy egg I've ever had at any restaurant)\nSlab Bacon\nTiramisu \n\nBut stay away from...\n\nBacon Egg Croissant (zero seasoning)\nSpinach Mushroom Frittata (also under-seasoned)\nPizza (very dry from sitting out too long)\nFlan (too gelatinous and awful flavor)\n\nThe only other thing I would mention is that the Gelato was not as awesome as I was expecting. The selection wasn't impressive and it wasn't sweet enough for my tastes. I've been to buffets that are less expensive and that aren't on the Strip that have better Gelato. \n\nHowever, the good definitely outweighs the bad here.

You now have to pre-check in at the kiosk then it'll print out a little receipt where it tells you what time to go back to the podium to check in and then wait in line to pay. \n\nWe got there at 4:45 expecting a long wait.. but instead we had to do the kiosk thing and ended up eating at 7pm instead and we were in a time crunch since we had a show at 9:30pm. If we had known this early, we wouldn't have been so rushed. Anyway, so i'm giving you a heads up now.\n\non to the food. same selection but less. looks like they cut down on the desserts. back in january i remember being able to select from 4 to 5 different mochi flavors, this time, just two. There were more ice cream / sorbets back in january, now there were only less than one row of ice cream selection... the other row was DISPLAY ONLY.\n\nthe crab legs were alright. still not as meaty, however, it is better than the first time i've visited. The stone crab claws were not good - no taste. If i'm paying over $50 for buffet, i expect better quality seafood. Those crab legs need to be upgraded to fatter ones. Those skinny legs are not acceptable. I can get those crab legs at a different buffet for a much lesser price.\n\ntheir turn around time for plates were slow this time. There were times when there were no plates at all in almost all of the stations. \n\ni must say that this 3rd visit, was a let down. Most of the time i was just walking around thinking what I should get to eat. Nothing really stood out this time (except for their miso glazed sea bass).\n\ni'm not sure if i'll be visiting bacchanal again if they continue with this quality of food. It just wasn't as good as when they first started. If that's the case, i rather spend less money at a different buffet and eat mediocre food. why pay so much and also get [slightly above] mediocre food?","review_id":"3tTLZ86xn-9VkdmoWTev2A","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":3,"useful":9,"user_id":"Vp5DzIiP_MmaMZMZVFFltA","date":"2014-07-03"},{"cool":7,"text":"The line up to dine at this buffet is absolutely ridiculous.  But for those in line, I guess it is worth the wait as they didn't seem to mind having to wait over an hour to eat.  Luckily as a Yelp Elite member, we got to by pass the line and was escorted to our tables without any hassles.  I like the ambiance of this place.  The tables were spaced apart decently without the feel of being crowded.  There were plenty of people there, but it didn't seemed that way because of its spacious interior.  The only time you notice the crowds, were when you are waiting in line for the seafood (crab legs).  The waiters were quite efficient and our dishes were cleared away each and every time we got back to our table with yet another full plate of food.  There were so many items to choose from, but the following were what I remembered having:    \n \nGinseng chicken soup served in individual clay pots.  This authentic Chinese soup is well worth the wait in line.  So flavourful and the chef did not skimp on the ginseng.  There actually was a ginseng root in each of its clay pots.\n \nBuffalo chicken wings.  Served in metal basket, so juicy and full of flavour.  A must try if you love buffalo wings.\n \nJumbo size cocktail shrimps.  These shrimps were so huge.  I only took a couple of them, because I wanted to save room to try all the other wonderful treats.\n \nAlaskan king crabs.  To me, it wasn't worth the wait.  Maybe I should have asked to have it heated up as others were doing.  \n \nStone crab claws.  Don't know what the fuss is all about.  Didn't really enjoy the crab.\n \nThe seafood section had the longest line up of them all.  By the time I got through the line in this section and got back to my table, all the seafood items I picked up were cold.  Cold seafood soup is not so good, neither were the cold crab coquettes.\n \nRoasted Duck.  Very tasty and moist.  Authentically prepared.  \n \nLamp chops.  Seared to perfection on the outside and still rare inside.  A wonderful treat for those who like lamb.\n \nPrime rib.  A little disappointing.  The slice I had was not that moist.  It didn't melt in the mouth like prime rib should.  \n \nSliders.  I think this would be very good, if it was hot.  But sitting out for any length of time, made the beef a little dry.  You get quite a thick burger on the slider.  \n \nSushi.  They had all the usual fare and I would say it's a step up from other buffets, but definitely not as fresh as in a real Japanese sushi joint. \n \nHar gow and shumai.  These Chinese dim sum items were both very good and authentic.  Quite big and flavourful.  Who needs to go to dim sum when you can get high quality dim sum at the buffet.  They also serve congee.  Just too much food to try everything.\n \nFried calamari.  Served in a metal basket, the batter that was used to fry the calamari was quite good, light and tasty.\n \nDessert.  The selection of desserts were okay.  There was nothing that was extraordinarily good. Had the tiramisu- was okay.  The chocolate crème brulee was quite good.  Gelatos - tried blood orange  - too sour for me, coffee - the flavour was good, and baklava - this was quite unique and tasty.  I don't remember the names of all the other desserts I tried.  Maybe I was just too full to truly enjoy the desserts.  \n \nConclusion - a truly fulfilling meal, with some high end items that just sets this place a step above all other buffets on the strip.  I would definitely go back.  There are some exceptionally good food items especially in the Chinese section.  There were so many other items that definitely warrants another trip to this buffet.  I am not too fond of having to wait in line, so I recommend going early or when they are about to close to avoid the very long lines.","review_id":"BA9wDltTJ7ysVut1AI1nEw","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":4,"useful":16,"user_id":"cImvLb3Wvd5EZ8SRjKAPsw","date":"2012-10-08"},{"cool":0,"text":"The food was good, great variety but I\"M PISSED.  I wanted to eat here on Xmas day, but it was a 5hr wait.  No thanks.  So, I think \" I'll go on Dec 26th for breakfast\".  Imagine my surprise, when we walk in( no wait at 8:30am), but am faced with a 50.00 brunch, not a 20.00 breakfast.  Yeah, I could have left, but we'd driven over from the Encore and were on our way back to Cali.  So, there went 110.00 down the drain.  I think its pretty shitty that they are still doing \" brunch\" even though its not a holiday.  The holiday was OVER.  Just a way to get more money from people. \n\nThat being said, I wasn't in the mood for seafood at 8:30am so I didn't get my money's worth.  There are signs all over the place to talk to the chef, if you have dietary restrictions.  I cant eat runny yolks because they make me burp something awful.  I wanted eggs benedict so I asked for poached whites.  I was told that they couldn't do that, I would need to talk to the dude making omelets.  I talk to him and he says he cant poach me a white, even though he has a big pot of simmering water right next to him. \n\nThat ticked me off.  If I am paying 50.00 for breakfast, I want a freaking poached egg white.  After awhile, I spoke to the manager who brought me to the chef.  I got my white and my toasted English muffin( they normally don't toast the muffins for bennies).  I didn't even want it at that point, but I got it. \n\nThere was a very large variety of food, but the only fresh juice I saw was OJ.

Unless you want to jump in the express line and fork out an extra $15! We went around dinner time and waited a little over an hour in line. Not too bad when you're with good company but my stomach was growling like a beast by the time we got seated. The buffet was hidden so if you do not know where it is, be sure to ask someone. They don't even have marquees with directions anywhere! Bacchanal is also on the pricey side but you are definitely getting your money's worth. Most buffets in town don't have fresh oysters which is why I love this one! There were pretty lengthy lines once we got inside as well. I think I waited about 10 minutes to get to the carved meats. Not a big deal because I already knew the wait was going to be long.  The service is what bugged me the most. I understand that they're busy but that does not mean they get a free pass for service. Our server was not very attentive at all.  He never once came to ask us for refills on our drinks or to see how we were doing.  We had to constantly call him over to get drinks, which he did not even get right on 2 separate occasions.  Also, every time he brought us new drinks, he just left the old glasses there.  By the end of our meal, we had a table full of 14 cups, yes I counted. For such a small table, that does not leave very much room for our plates. It was super annoying.  We also witnessed him yelling at the busser for some unknown reason a few times.  It was very unprofessional and made us uncomfortable.  I think we were just unlucky with our server.  Other than the service, I think Bacchanal is pretty decent.  I probably wont be coming back though just because the wait is so long.","review_id":"sSspkjXLHvaAOLF3A0-sOw","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"3r9BVzKJ7jA4SCDgjhBzZQ","date":"2013-11-27"},{"cool":0,"text":"Raises the standard for Vegas buffets.

Some of the foods are served on small plates or on large pans where you can serve yourself.  We went for brunch so they were still serving breakfast.  Based on my memory, they were serving the following: Red Velvet Pancakes, pancakes, French Toasts, Fried chicken & waffles, sausages, prime rib, lamb chops, brisket, pork belly, Mac n Cheese, Churros, pizza, pasta station (choose your pasta and they cook it for you), dumplings, fried rice, duck, egg rolls, oysters, salmon, crab legs, sushi, and more!!  \n\n ::Dessert::\nFor my favorite part, they had a variety of things: gelato, cookies, cupcakes, lava cake, cake pops, tiramisu, crème brulee, candies, and cake slices, etc.  I was surprised to see they had Ube (Filipino Dessert) but it didn't taste like Ube.  Unfortunately, non of the desserts \"wow'd\"me.  \n\n:: Highlight::\nWe ate a lot of Crab Legs!!  It tasted so good with lemon and warm butter. \n\n:: Customer Service::\nFriendly but slow.

This took the sting out of this $50.00 buffet particulary! \n\nFirst off the wait on this Thurs night was only about 40 minutes in a line that moved quickly.  Once in, the restauraunt is beautiful and surprisingly calm for how many are dining there. We were very graciously greeted and introduced to the buffet. The decor and music were fantastic. \n\nAll food stations were well stocked and looking good. Given the high cost of the meal I focused on King Crab, Jumbo Shrimp, Ribeye and Brisket. All were fantastic though the Ribeye was tough IMO. The green peach ice tea is beyond delicious.. Desserts were breathtaking and fun to sample several...the maccaroons were awesome!\n\nService was basically pretty good though dishes could have been cleared alittle quicker.\n\nI do have to mention the cook who I asked about where to find the watermelon/feta salads I was so looking forward to...she apologised and said they would not be available that night then immediately offered to make one special for me...I was stunned!

I ate here for brunch at around 2:30pm and got to eat for dinner also because Dinner starts at 3pm. So instead of paying for dinner price I paid at a brunch price. In the video, you will see both the brunch food and the dinner food that they brought out. HINT: If you don't want to pay dinner price, dine during the lunch hours and wait a bit before the bring out the dinner food.\n\nI had a great time eating at this truly epic buffet as mentioned by their ads in and around the casino\n\nWe had a great server, who always would come by and clear the plates.\n\nI love their open kitchen design. It's so clean and modern. I love how the foods were displayed and presented instead of having them on aluminum tray at the station for us to go and grab it. All the crab legs were already sliced in half, so you don't need a claw cracker. The only complained was that I wish the crab legs were steam instead of being cold.\n\nThey even have street taco! and a whole bunch of salsas to choose from as you can see halfway through my video. I love their rotating grill where they cook your tacos. \n\nThey also have the best dessert bar in term of dessert presentation. \n\nOverall, I love this place.

My daughter is 4 and although I paid for her, she barely ate! All she had was 1/2 a juice and 1/4 of a char Sui bao. I should've called to see what their seafood selection was for Sunday brunch. Unfortunately there were no oysters, which is what he really wanted. The crab legs had to do! Overall the food was good. Decent selection, but for the price I think it's better to come for dinner. As with most buffets we've been to there are always a few items that have been out too long. I don't remember our servers name, but he was ok. Not the worst and not the best. He couldn't get our drink order- 2 Reg coffees, 1 decaf and 4 waters. We got the 2 coffees and 3 waters. Then when we asked for the decaf, we also had to ask for a cup. It wasn't even busy yet either. Oh well, at leas he asked if we were done with our plates instead of just taking them.","review_id":"wzQ1JVPVUsNSywSKDwFosg","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"Yj79QbOyYO1q6ythwB3bvQ","date":"2014-11-10"},{"cool":23,"text":"This is the KING of buffets!! 25,000-square-foot buffet extravaganza.\n\nIt is SO worth it to eat here. =) Lines can get long here so get here early.\n\nSo many varieties of different foods here that its unbeatable & unbelievable.\n\n9  live stations (chefs cook it live): seafood, Asian, Mexican, Italian and dessert, that present hundreds of daily items.\n\nMy faves:\n\nShrimp jumbo cocktails so fresh & delicious 11pts\n\nSea bass so buttery & flavorful 11pts\n\nSnow crab legs - be sure to ask them to steam them if u like them warm.\n\nOyster shooters so delicious 11 pts\n\nSeafood & Chinese station was great.\n\nItalian & meat station was ok.\n\nCreme brulee was very yummy & not too sweet 9pts\n\nMochi ice cream was yummy 8 pts\n\nGelato station was so delicious w/ so many delicious flavors to choose from (you can sample each one of the flavors if you like. =) 10 pts\n\nDark Chocolate dipped strawberries were huge but  not sweet. =( 7pts\n\nDeserts looked very pretty & there was a huge variety but the flavors were off.\n\nWicked Spoon's desserts are better.\n\nService is great here. =)\n\nFYI, if you sign up for their rewards card you will get a discount for this buffet with that card here. \n\nOpen daily.\n\nBreakfast (Monday - Friday, 7 a.m. - 11 a.m.): $25.99\nBrunch (Saturday - Sunday, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $40.99\nLunch (Monday - Friday, 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $32.99\nDinner (Daily, 3 p.m. - 10 p.m.): $45.99 on weekdays, $50.99 on weekends","review_id":"RlfWnU9PttN0PWkVmDqpEQ","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":15,"useful":43,"user_id":"yLW8OrR8Ns4X1oXJmkKYgg","date":"2013-03-07"},{"cool":0,"text":"great ambiance and acid jazz music!

The line was not crazy, but when we left it was, so we hit the sweet spot, apparently.  The line moved quickly, and there was even loungy mood music playing, which helped pass the time. The cost was $45/person. \n\nThis new buffet had beautiful ambiance, natural lighting, friendly staff (the guy at the meat carving station was super friendly!).  The tables were quickly bussed, and the layout was very big! It went on and on.  Mostly everything was clean and replenished often.  They even give you mini-potholders made of plastic to help you grip hot bowls and pans. \n\nSmall rant:  I HATE those individual serving containers! From mini-pots/pans to baskets, to bowls!! UGH! They take up a lot of room on your plate, you can't really hold them in your other hand, and they are just frustrating in general! I'm at a buffet! Stop trying to restrict my servings! Or at least give me a cafeteria tray so I can put everything there. I was tempted a few times to dump the food out of the fancy-schmancy little dishes and just onto my plate, but I resisted the urge. \n\nRant over.\n\nOf course, on a buffet, food can be hit or miss.  I loved the steamed (chilled) shrimp, the seafood pasta, the mushroom risotto, the chicken marsella, and the ribs.  I also thought the ham and cheese croissants were great, and enjoyed the brisket as well.  I also really liked the freshly made crepe- a nice ending to a meal. The coconut shrimp was just ok- I didn't see any sauce for it, and the sweet potato tater tots were great!  I had a small bite of the sliders, and they were tasty too.\n\nI tried some of the Asian offerings- the spicy fish was super spicy (lots of chili pepper), and the dumplings were fine.  I skipped the pizza and most of the pasta selections. There were also sushi offerings and a few Mexican items too.\n\nOn the negative side, the crab legs (which can be steamed upon request), were rather puny, and the mac&cheese was nothing great. Neither was the fried chicken in the chicken and waffle basket (not very seasoned).  I was pretty disappointed with the French toast too (bland).  The bread pudding seemed to be the only thing that wasn't refreshed- it looked old and picked over.\n\nOn balance, I still think the M buffet is tops around.  Next, I'd probably give the edge to Wicked Spoon, because their food is a bit more flavorful.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I finally checked it out, but isn't going to be a must-do on my buffet list.","review_id":"k4iqFESZ5T97imZ-lg6INg","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":3,"user_id":"lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg","date":"2013-07-29"},{"cool":0,"text":"Prepare to come hungry and leave happy!

There's dim sum options, soups, and vegetables as usual. I actually was surprised with the flavoring of the black chicken stew. It's not exactly on point, but it's good enough!\n\nAs for the entrees, there's crab legs!! I think we got about 2-3 plates of those. Not only that, but some of the food dishes are served in small portions, which is helpful in preventing you from \"overeating.\" What I mean by that is that you leave more room in your stomach for the other dishes. The sweet potato tater tots were delicious! In addition to the prime rib and the truffle potato gratin!\n\nSome other memorable choices that I've tried was the lobster clam chowder and caprese salad and the artisan sausage. There's seriously lots of things to eat here! Another favorite of mine was the lasagna!!\n\nNow onto the desserts, they have mochi ice cream! Vanilla, Kona Coffee, and Chocolate. I was a bit disappointed there was no mango or green tea, but -shrugs- the dessert was still good. They had French macaroons as well as ice cream! The mango lime sorbet was my favorite along with the creme brulee.\n\nMy stomach had the time of its life here. One thing about this place though is the expensive price.

When you think Buffet you think of a place with a ton of variety but mediocre (to sometimes bad) quality.  A trade off people quite often are OK with.  Bacchanal moves to change that dynamic.  The food here is excellent.  To put this in perspective, you can put the food here up against most 4 star restaurants and come out even or in some cases ahead.  This gives you variety of amazing food choices from all over the world, combines with quality you'd get at stand-alone restaurants.\n\nThere does come a sacrifice however as you are getting both quality and variety and this is price.  Be prepared to pay $58/person for this buffet (not including any alcohol you may want to partake in).  Is it worth it?  I believe so.  If you go to any great restaurant in Las Vegas, you are going to be paying between $50-$100 per person anyway.  At $60 here you also get the variety you lack at a stand alone which to me is worth it.\n\nNow for the food:\n\nThey have several sections: (my memory is not 100% so not all options listed)\n\n*Seafood - Crab legs, sea bass, salmon, dover sole, oysters, clams, mussels\n*Carved Meats - Lamb, Prime Rib, Ribs, Steak, Sausage\n*American - Hot dogs, Mashed Potatoes, Fried Chicken, Fries (sweet & regular)\n*Italian - Antipasta bar(cheeses and meats), Meatballs, Ravioli, Pasta, Pizza\n*Asia - Soup station (Pho, Ramen, Curry, Egg Drop, Noodle, Hot & Sour), Sushi, Chinese Favorites, Dumplings, Baos & other Dim Sum, Bahn Mi, Pork Belly\n*Taco Station where they created street tacos for you\n*Dessert - Pretty much everything you can want including a Gelato section and Sugar Free section\n\n\nDo not expect to get through everything...it is too much...I tried!  I can recommend however my favorites so you make sure you get those on your plate.\n\nThe Meatballs were outstanding!  My #1 pick there.\nThe Ravioli\nThe Lo Mein noodles\nThe Pork Belly\nThe Bahn Mi\nThe Ribs from carving station (typically these meats at the carving stations are dried out and gross, but this was smoked beautifully)\n\n\nAgain, many of the items were amazing, but those were the stand outs.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy!

Namely: The onion rings; crispy, hot, salty, and a little bit spicy, the fried chicken, which was damn near perfect, the peach brisket, the meat and cheese section, and several of the deserts.\n- The desert variety is diabetes provoking. I got one of everything, since they are only one or two bites, and was just a horrible person that lets children starve in africa, and didn't eat more than one bite of anything I didn't LOVE.\n- Did I mention the cured meat and cheese section? that was awesome.\n- I did not feel awful after eating here. I did have a \"wow I haven't eaten that much sugar since I was 9 at halloween\" buzz going, but that was my own damn fault.\n\nCons:\n- Price. Ooof. Not sure that was worth it, but it was definitely part attraction and fun for the family. Wouldn't go with just the two of us on a weeknight or anything.\n- Dat LINE. Holy COW that was a long wait for what the buffet ended up being.

The lines weren't that crazy either, but it did seem to me like there was way too much of some of the food.  For example, I took a little dish of what looked like an open-faced egg sandwich with a poached egg on top.  It looked delicious, but when I took a bite of it, the egg was over-cooked and it was luke-warm.  I think if it had been fresher, it would have been delicious.  The prime rib was just okay.  The crab legs were quite dismal.  The dimsum was yuck.  Bacon is always delicious but I felt like I was drinking a shot of grease when I ate the slice of bacon..not complaining too much because bacon is bacon and is always delicious but could've done without all the grease.  My friend grabbed some dessert, which I tried a bite of.  The icecream with a brownie was really delicious.  The cookies weren't even as good as a box of nestle chewy chocolate chip cookies.

The $25 express fee to skip the lines may be worth it as well. They have kiosks before the long lines where you enter in your phone number and they will text you when to come back to wait in line.

I loved that the crab legs were already cut in half for us so we wouldn't have to crack them ourselves. The crab legs were very sweet, juicy and meaty. I really enjoyed the meat/BBQ selection...the prime rib was DIVINE. It was cooked to perfection and had just the right about of rare-ness to it. I decided to skip the Mexican section since it didn't look that appealing to me. The Asian food section was impressive. I was very amused as a Vietnamese person that they had pho! The dumplings/dim sum were very decent, I had to refrain from eating more to save room in my tummy. The sushi rolls here were MEH...but the hand rolls were on point. The pasta from the Italian section was lacking a bit of flavor...but the ravioli was awesome. The desserts were great! Give me flan and creme brûlée and I'm a happy camper. \n\nManagement here is really great and all about customer service.

The long lines right now are no joke, but it's a little misleading, as they tend to slow things down as you get closer to the cashier -- they don't want a bunch of people clogging up the front area to get seated.\n\nI consider myself a Vegas buffet veteran, as I've tried just about every one. The first thing one should know is that it's a bit difficult to compare each and every buffet out there. Each one has its pros and cons, it's own inconsistencies, and nuances. It all depends on what you like. Rating buffets is very subjective, to say the least.\n\nThat being said, I thought the new buffet at Caesar's was okay, nothing earth shattering in terms of Vegas buffets. I'm going to judge a buffet mostly by its seafood, meat, and dessert. Here's my breakdown:\n\nSeafood -- they offer pre-cut, cold king crab legs. However, upon request, they will steam a plate of crab legs for a few minutes. This inevitably holds up the line longer than it should, because it seems like most people don't get out of the way while they're waiting. I got my fair share (and money's worth) of king crab, but it tasted rather bland even with the melted butter -- the snow crab legs had a lot more flavor. \n\nThe stone claws may look appetizing at first, made famous by Joe's Stone Crab. But once you get into the meat (and that's a big if), the meat inside is dry, crumbly, and flavorless. The tin cans of clam bake, fish entrees, and mussels were all dry, shriveled up, and rather pathetic-looking. Sad face. \n\nMeat -- thankfully, I enjoyed all of their meat options over the seafood. The prime rib was excellent, and the brisket was actually good. Smoky and reasonably flavorful, with a nice bark. They don't slice against the grain, so it can get a bit chewy.\n\nDessert -- thumbs up for the dessert crepe station and the great gelato flavors. Everything else was just so-so. The cheesecake and dessert on a stick may look cute, but it just didn't have much flavor. Overall, I thought dessert options were rather limited.\n\nAs for the other food options, I thought everything was just okay. The thing with buffets is that a lot of food just sits out in the open -- getting its life slowly sucked out. As we all know, food is at its best when it's pipin' hot and freshly made. So food like dim sum, sushi, and other of these delicate dishes all suffer as a result.\n\nNone of the dishes are anything original, but where this buffet stands out are things like the cheeses and the charcuterie spread. The problem is, will people eat this at a buffet? Each time I walked by, nobody was even remotely slowing down to put some on their plate. Mostly everyone will be stuffing themselves with meat, seafood, and dessert. \n\nI was torn between 3 or 4 stars, but I'll go with 4 stars because this buffet does offer some unique options, king crab legs (which is crazy expensive, so we'll see how long that lasts) and a good meat station. So if you're a fan of Vegas buffets, it's worth a shot. Whether you return for a repeat visit remains to be seen.","review_id":"JTdXlorW5njFkgUvtIT_zw","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":9,"useful":13,"user_id":"KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g","date":"2012-09-18"},{"cool":12,"text":"B est buffet in Vegas\nA ll you can eat\nC harges you $65\nC hoose from hundreds of dishes\nH eavenly place\nA mazed by the seafood selection\nN eed a nap after getting food coma\nA wesome service\nL ove love love!\n\nDine at Bacchanal to feed not only your tummy, but also your eyes.

Haven't been back to the Bacchanal Buffet since a Yelp event several years ago.  4 stars!\n\nGroupon, I love you.  Thank you for blessing us with your coupon that granted the wifey and I entrance to the sin of gluttony.  VIP breakfast M-F for two at $65?  Plus I had an extra coupon to lower that price 20%?  Sign me up baby!  Not only did we get to go to the shorter 'Fast Pass' line, we saved bucks on the meal too!  Get in by 10:30 AM - skim some breakfast, stay for lunch!  Yes we did!\n\nThe buffet is truly MASSIVE.  You wouldn't believe the kind of work and planning running a shindig like this takes.  I used to run the UNLV Dining Commons and that was work.  This must be WORK.  There's almost everything imaginable to eat, and things that you didn't even know you wanted to eat!

But damn, it's so hard to remember EVERYTHING we ate!  Luckily I took pics which I will happily include.  There was just so much I sampled.  I feel like between wifey and I we tried nearly every major item at each station!  Endless mimosas didn't help me either.

Not because we wanted to, but because I wanted to maintain the integrity of my review.  Ok, we wanted to eat!  This being a buffet there is great variety, but of course quality is always hard to keep in check.  Most of the items we sampled were very good, I don't really have a complaint because a buffet like this is not often on my radar because of price.  My only gripe is that some of the things were either cold or old from sitting on the line too long.  The red velvet pancakes were chewy since they sat too long.  My steak & eggs were overdone from sitting under the heat lamp too long.  But these are minor complaints because it is a buffet.  Plus, just about everything else we had was darn tasty!  Quality standards are above buffets of lower caliber.  Many unique things you won't find at other buffets!  Like ramen!  And it was decent!  The street tacos were excellent because of the fresh hand made tortillas!  Exotic shaved ice to order with green tea, condensed milk, and azuki beans?  Come on!  \n\nI do have a big complaint though with regards to service.  This is why I had to take this review down a notch.  We were basically ignored throughout our entire meal by our server!  After taking our initial drink order, he only came by ONCE to check on us and refill our drinks, after I had to flag him down!  And we were there over an hour!  Horrible, horrible inattentive service!  Our busboy did majority of the work clearing our plates!  This was bad enough we had to take to talking with the assistant manager, tables around us were all being served by this guy & we were promptly being straight up IGNORED.  Assistant manager assured us this was very unusual and would have a talk with our server.  We still tipped well of course, but I hope most of it went to our busboy!\n\nIf Groupon does this deal again, will I be back?  You can bet your Arnold Schwarzenegger lovin' @$$ I will!

Other standouts were the dumplings, cheese station, crab legs, cake pops, and little jars of agua fresca.

We went for breakfast and dinner and likely left Las Vegas a few pounds heavier due to all the awesome food. This was top notch, restaurant quality food served in buffet form. I see people complain about spending over $55 for one buffet dinner, but honestly, where else can you get unlimited crab legs, stone crab claws, shrimp, oysters, prime rib, beef brisket, sausage, pho, ramen, made-to-order crepes, gelato...the list goes on and on and on...all for around $55.

Is every single item they put out perfect? No. But the majority of the items are great. There was even a chocolate cake pop at the dessert station that completely blew my mind.  A cake pop!!  And did I mention that the selection is so wide and varied that I think a normal person would need at least 4-5 visits at different times of day to experience a bit of it all? Other Yelp reviewers go over the different food stations so I won't repeat that here.  Suffice to say there was just so much good food!\n\nAs for service, it was generally good.

Some of the misses didn't have anything to do with the food really, but the layout.  \n\nBecause the prime rib and seafood stations are inherrently the most popular, it was very difficult to navigate through to the supporting cast of the super stars.  If you wanted a classic side dish of mac n' cheese or mashed potatoes, you had to wait in the prime rib line or dare to cut someone off.  The lines to the buffet also spilled into the main walkway where incoming guests were feeding through; it made the space feel a bit busy and crowded.  \n\nI know it's new, but I think it was a bit too cramped for my taste.

The oysters were horrible. My husband loves oysters and he could not stand it. There was a little mini scallop salad from the Asian section which was okay, but definitely did not deserve the money we spent to eat \"good.\" I never trust buffet sushi anyway, but the sushi really did not look good. The prime rib was overcooked and the mussels were literally swimming in butter that had absolutely no remarkable flavors. I tried a few things like the caprese salad, the mini burgers, the mini nachos, the gyoza, vegetable and spring rolls.

I'm just happy with the live crepe station where you are responsible to create/pour your own toppings! Love love fresh crepes! The large strawberries were fresh and dipped in green tea and white chocolate. The sweet potato fries was one of the best I've had! It was piping hot so I made sure I took some. \n\nThe Mexican station where all the fresh juice you can consume such as horchata, guava and strawberry drinks! Oh my! They were all refreshing! It's a VERY overwhelming place to eat. So, make sure you have a strategy prior to your arrival to break even what you paid for. I'm overwhelmed writing this review because there's too many positive things that I failed to mention. I over stuffed myself with the crab legs and left no room for the meat galore!

Another thing I loved was their personal soup bowl of \"Black Chicken w/ Ginseng\" at the Chinese corner. The ramen was good as well. The soup base for it was pretty decent and light rather than heavy. Other than those three, there wasn't much to celebrate about or brag about. \n\n\nI felt, in my opinion, that there wasn't enough variety. There wasn't really anything that screamed at me to try it.

My Babe and I arrived around 3.00 and waited a mere 5 minutes and were seated at a great table close to all the food.\n\nThe restaurant is decorated in a very trendy and modern look.  The chairs are super comfortable and the food is beautifully presented.\n\nAfter an hour of eating, I was in pure heaven.  The Chinese Dim Sum, Duck, Sausage, Beef Brisket, Fried Chicken, etc were also so yummy.  The deserts were super awesome as well.\n\nThe quality, selection and presentation of the food is 2nd to none!\n\nThis is by far the best buffet in LV.  Bellagio, Wynn and Wicked Spoon are good, but Bacchanal is outfuckingstanding!!  NO BJ needed tonight......yup.  So satisfied!","review_id":"4MBobXH4o02dISRehHT75A","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":4,"useful":5,"user_id":"SIpBqzGhRM7T5cDFiuIryg","date":"2016-03-07"},{"cool":3,"text":"When you walk in to a buffet and they give you a small rubber contraption just to hold hot plates with...you know your palette is in for some insane-whatever-happens-in-vegas-stays-in-vegas-goodness... but man, oh man, that is an understatement.  You walk in and the place looks like a 5-star restaurant...the ambiance, and the presentation of everything is simply majestic.  But of course...what are we here for?  What are you reading this review for?  the FOOD!!!!\n\nI gotta say, I am totally in LOVE with Bacchanal Buffet.  Why?  I'll give you at least TEN reasons why...I can probably give you 50, but time is of the essence, and I'm sure you don't have that much essence to read a review of that length...\n\n1)  Portions - the presentation and portion size is such a great idea, not that they were the first ones to ever create it, but still, it's nice to have it already prepared for you to take because the serving has been set; that way you avoid the possibility of loading up too much on certain items.  It seems like you should be walking around with cafeteria trays just to carry all the single portions around, but I guess that prevents you from overloading too\n\n2) Wagyu beef sliders....O M G, if you've never heard of grass fed beef, Wagyu I heard is some form of Kobe beef hybrid...but it is EXCELLENT.  Definitely worth getting a few of them.\n\n3)  Crab legs...you have the option of getting them steamed.  Just ask for them, don't get them from the cold iced area, give them an empty plate and ask for the steamed crab legs\n\n4)  Ramen - Never saw a buffet actually have ramen, udon, and pho before, and I would never have thought it would be so good, but d to the ayam man...it really was.  The broth was excellent!  I HAD to stop myself from getting more so that I could be sure to try everything.\n\n5)  Breakfast items...skirt steak and eggs, truffled potatoes, mini-red velvet pancakes and even CRONUTS were the standouts for the breakfast items to note.  \n\n6)  Fresh squeezed juices...poured into single-serve carafes...another awesome idea, both presentation-wise and practical...wise, he he he.  Horchata, Carrot, and your normal juices all available, super fresh, and super good. :)\n\n7)   Carne Asada tacos...man!  Such good quality carne asada makes for some amazing tacos!\n\n8)  Gelato, ice cream, too many too choose from for dessert, especially the....\n\n9)  Lava cake for dessert....just the way you'd want to have it\n\n10) Oh before i forget, PEELED Jumbo Shrimp coctail...I LOVE that!   I hate peeling shrimp, esp for shrimp coctail, he he he.  \n\nI mean, i can only review what I remember...I almost wish I had my laptop and a video camera during the whole experience, but hey, we do what we can. :)\n\nWish there were some oysters, but could've been an availability thing.\n\nIt's roughly $50 bucks unless you're some sort of high roller, so for us commoners...it can be a little steep...but TRUST me, it's totally worth it!   Your stomach will be thanking you for days.  \n\nHands down my absolute favorite  buffet out there...I've hit up Bellagio, M, Rio Seafood and regular, and pretty much all of the main buffets out there(still haven't tried the one at Cosmo yet), but it is head and shoulders above the rest.  I still like M, but just the items here blew me away.\n\nService staff is very friendly and you can pretty much ask for anything...don't forget your mimosas...for those of you over 21 of course.\n\nMy Advice, go early for brunch...esp if you like breakfast items, because you get the best of both worlds.  I would say to come around 10-10:30 on a the weekends to avoid the crazy crowds and to ensure you start getting your food quick.  \n\nI haven't yet tried dinner and I know that there are some items that are available ONLY at dinner, such as the Macarons, but I don't really care much for them, and we confirmed with some hosts that the most variety is available around brunch time.\n\nI used to say that I can't come to vegas without putting a SINGLE bet on something...but now I gotta say I can't come to vegas without eating at Bacchanal! :)","review_id":"82Vp_zXv7NgfqzfY6CKJcA","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":3,"useful":7,"user_id":"mteJOlja359dj7XYQnKzCg","date":"2013-09-10"},{"cool":3,"text":"I have to say, good job Ceasers for FINALLY making a buffet that *should* be in a place like yours.  I've been wanting to go since it was announced that they were even making it and then the reviews came out.  But the last time I was in Vegas, they had just opened, and it was NYE weekend so we didn't even venture to the strip (I was staying with a friend who lives in Vegas).  But this time, we were staying across the street.  There was NO WAY I was going to miss out.\n\nDinner during the weekend is about $55, Sunday Brunch was $45.  I think.  You get like a dollar or two off with your Total Rewards membership card.\n\nThere is a virtual queue - you will see the computers set up.  Make sure to go up and pull a ticket.  This will tell you when to come back to get back in line to pay and then get seated.  There are NO SIGNS for this or anyone telling you to do it.  I'm sure it's not as crazy during the week but on the weekends, this is a must.\n\nWhen my friend and I were there Friday night pretty late and we had NO problems getting in.  We didn't even know about the virtual queue.  But on Saturday when we returned with more friends, we were denied entry and it was only 730pm.  They had already filled up their virtual queue and were not letting anyone else get in line.  It was basically sold out.  We had talked to a lady in line and she said that they were there at 6, got a ticket and it said to come back at 8.  The buffet closes at 1030pm.  Since we were hungry, we left and went to another place for dinner.  \n\nHowever, we did return Sunday for brunch before we left town. \n\nNow on to the food!\n\nThere are several stations:\n\nSeafood - oysters on the half shell, crab legs (cold and warmed up with hot water at request), shrimp, and various other seafood dishes.  There is a warm drawn butter machine for you!\n\nItalian - pizza, pasta, meatballs and a made to order pasta station\n\nAsian - an assortment of dim sum items (buns, shumai, etc) plus the usual chinese fare - kung pao chicken, chow mein, fried rice etc. also had some pad thai and some other meat options that I don't remember. A small assortment of sushi (there was definitely more fish on the sushi during dinner than brunch) There is also a noodle station to order where you can get udon, pho or ramen.\n\nCarving station - there is so much meat here, your head will spin.  Prime Rib, baby back ribs, smoked brisket, smoked turkey, a variety of sausage links, lamb chops.  During brunch, they had more sausage varieties, but I had to wait until it was closer to lunch time to get some brisket and ribs.  I asked the guy carving and he went in the back and got them.  I had turkey on Friday dinner but they had run out of the brisket (since we were close to closing time).  Both were really good.\n\nMexican - you can get tacos to order.  There was also beans, rice, carnitas, machaca, chicken, a salsa bar and a juice bar.\n\nAmerican -  I don't know what else to call this area - it's where they have the mashed potatoes, veggies, mac and cheese, etc.  They didn't have any fried chicken when we were there for dinner, but at brunch they had it to go with waffles.  There were sweet potato tots, roasted potatoes, french fries. I think i seriously had a plate of potatoes.  There were even baked potatoes available.  Mini sliders (which we were sure they had been sitting for a while) were a little dry.\n\nSalad bar - I didn't venture too much here - but there was a variety of salads and dressings you could get.  There was also a lot of fruit, a variety of cheese and cured meats.  And a huge area with a variety of bread.\n\nDessert - There is a gelato bar with some interesting flavors, crepes to order with plenty of whipped cream, berries, bananas foster and nutella to your hearts content.   During dinner there were macaroons and chocolate covered strawberries but they didn't have it when we were there during brunch.  There is the usual variety of cakes, cookies, brownies, and creme brulee as well.\n\nI'm sure I missed all sorts of things.  The food was pretty amazing.  There were a few things that we didn't like, but for the most part it was really good.  I mean - we went twice in  a weekend !  Definitely will be back.","review_id":"vswt1L_NPXfGYze2h6KvrQ","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":3,"useful":5,"user_id":"QPgXLWsDRplZilp2OciAiw","date":"2014-04-09"},{"cool":0,"text":"Everybody raves about this place, and now I see why.

We happened to show up during the Blue Plate Special Senior Citizen Hour and only had to wait about 20 minutes. By the time we left, the line was wrapped around the corner and down the hall. \n\n$54/person isn't too bad at all. We had reservations at CUT but after my less than stellar performance with the dice in my hand, we had to rethink the situation to save a few shekels. Such is life in Vegas. \n\nMake sure you packed your bottle of Patience because it's a real bleep show at times. See, tourists feel compelled to get their moneys worth. Ya know that over the top camera with the telephoto lens? Cost a pretty penny I'm sure, but it doesn't belong at a buffet. However, these folks clearly disagree because at least 4 times, as I was attempting to get my grub on, these camera carrying peeps were in full blown photo shoot mode. I get it, the buffet looks good. Relax slugger. Honestly? What do you do with those photos once you get them developed in your dark room? \n\nFood: Overall 4 star food experience indeed. Alaskan crab legs were the best I've ever tried, the prime rib was a quality slab of beef, despite the fatty piece I received. Wide selection of just better than supermarket sushi, which I didn't have the guts to try. Very nice selection of Asian options. My faves include: crispy duck, Korean BBQ spareribs. Dim sum options didn't look all that great, but the dumplings tasted pretty darn good. \n\nDessert: Beyond incredible selection and every single item I tried was delicious! Fresh gelato was excellent. They even had tiny waffle bowls dipped in chocolate, which were hidden on top of the counter. \n\nIn closing, I would say that this dining experience was pretty good. I will say that all the chefs were working very hard and doing their best to provide food quickly and that's a huge plus in my book. I'd definitely visit them again, but if I have better luck at the craps table, I am headed to CUT instead.","review_id":"1zKgllq1Da930DWBEClu_Q","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":2,"useful":3,"user_id":"ENtSjbekFHjltp2TFkstHg","date":"2015-03-17"},{"cool":0,"text":"I'm sad To give this place two stars even though everyone loves it.

I had the green tea chocolate strawberry and was not feeling the crunchy stuff on it. I did like the lemon basil sorbet though. It was refreshing and light. \n\nWe were there for about 45 mins and they started cleaning up the stations and cleared all the food. My poor friend only had 2 plates.

BAIT AND SWITCH.\n\nOk...I came here about a month after opening for a Yelp Elite event.  It was free.  It was glorious.  Now it's chalk full of problems.\n1) No Monta ramen.  For tourists, this is a local ramen joint that is very popular with the foodies.  They hired someone from there to help them with their ramen.  It was close to the real deal.  Last night?  Gone gone gone.  At the Yelp event, they even had the head buffet chef walking around bragging about how much trouble they were to for the ramen.  I believe him.  So what happened?  Good thing I didn't pay $50 for this buffet expecting this ramen.  Oh wait...$50 it was!\n2) Whoever manages this buffet needs a demotion, stat.  At even the premium buffets in town you expect to wait for seafood.  Crab legs, etc.  Mostly the crab legs take a lot of work and it's a bottleneck.  Fine.  \nAt Bacchanal, they had combined the seafood and carving station lines into one, gigantic line.  GIGANTIC. Moved slower than molasses in the winter, too.  Not only did that make carving station only patrons wait a VERY LONG time for some meats that were ready to go, the long line obscured about 25% of the buffet's offerings.  And most of the \"good stuff\" if we're being honest.  Basically, if you wanted fried chicken, or any of the potatoes, any bread, a whole host of things - you had to squeeze your way in between the dirty looks of people who thought you might be cutting in line.  How's about separating the lines?  Oh wait...they DID end up separating.  After I complained to a manager and was told, I'm not kidding, \"Just go ahead and walk up to the carving station and ask for what you need.  Just bypass the line.\"  Whatchu talkin' bout Willis?! Despite my misgivings,  I tried that assuming the people were all in line for seafood.  They weren't.  I almost got murdered by the people in line. \nOnly my cat like reflexes saved me.  \nAlso, they had 1 chef at the carving station - all the while a huge line was continuing to build.  Here's a hint - have another person there carving while another person takes orders and serves it up?  The lady in front of me literally took, and I timed this, 3 minutes to get 3 different kinds of meat.  With like 30 people behind her and growing.  The line is long and the meat is not going to sit there more than a minute if you cut it early.  It's already rested - it's fine!  Good thing I didn't pay $50 for this buffet.  Oh wait...I did!\nWhen I went before, they obviously had separate lines.  It took ME to get them to separate it despite the seriously angry patrons.  And no surprise things went much smoother afterwards.  Hey Caesars Palace - where's my paycheck? I managed your buffet for one night, Gary Loveman(CEO of Caesars).\n3) No fresh fruit except for blackberries.  They used to have great chocolate covered strawberries.  We were told they had been out since 2 days ago.  Thank God I didn't pay something outrageous like $50 for this buffet only to have them run out of the most popular fruit in existence.  Oh wait...I did pay $50.  F$#k me!  Great I'll get some rasberries.  No?  No rasberries either?  Well...we are in the desert.  At least I didn't pay....\n4) Dishes at the table took a good long while to be cleared.  Not the biggest deal in the world - but when your table is full it does get a big messy.\nOn the positives:\n1) For our group, we paid $15 extra each to skip the line to get in.  Well worth it if you're willing to shell out the $15.  Looked like at least an hour wait if not more.  Wish other places would have that option.\n2) The carving station meats were pretty good.  Sausage was spicy and delicious.  BBQ ribs were tender and flavorful.  And the ribeye was solid.  The brisket, however, was awful. Dry as a bone and really overcooked.\n3) Desserts were nice.  I didn't eat much but the Kona Coffee mochi was very very good.  One of my friends had a crepe and she thought it was one of the best she's had.  So big thumbs up for the dessert stations.  Oh yeah..and no wait.  haha\n4) Temperature was fine in the buffet.  Also, no fire, flood, nuclear explosion, etc.  Hmm....struggling to think of things to come up with in this section.  No terrorists!\n\nIn a nutshell, if you're already at Caesars and $50 isn't a ton of cash for you to spend then go for it.  It's perfectly fine.\n\nIf you're making a special trip to a buffet then I'd recommend Bellagio or Wynn over this one.  \n\nJust disappointing to see them pull out all the stops initially to generate that good publicity.  Then just bend you over and stick it in rough like this.  It's brutal.  Really, I should give this kind of crap the 1 star treatment.  You know what?  I will.  Dropping to 1 star. \n\nHonestly pays.

Tonight we decided to try something different and went to the Bacchanal Buffet at  Caesars Palace.\n\n*** With all these five star ratings I really need to explain my two star rating ***\n\nThe food at this buffet is definitely above average and there are a lot of things to choose from.  \n\nThe staff that handled our beverages and dishes were prompt and friendly.\n\nThe meat selections are pretty tasty and there are a lot of seafood dishes.\n\nThe items that stood out for me personally were the freshly shucked oysters as well as the very tasty lamb chops.  Also, the crepes to order in the dessert area were awesome with a selection of fresh berries.\n\n*** Here are the challenges they need to overcome that may affect your visit...\n\n1.  After spending about 40 minutes in line to pay for the buffet, you spend a little more time in a \"continuation line\" waiting to be seated by hostess.  The problem is that tonight the hostesses were seating diamond and VIP players card members first before seating ANY of the regular paying customers.  I spoke with a manager named Stefani (sp?) and she told me that the hostesses were to seat people at a 3 VIP to 1 regular customer ratio when there were two lines.  This definitely didn't happen tonight as we waited for the entire VIP line of perhaps 50 or so people (about 12 - 15 different groups) to be seated before us which took about 25 minutes.  After paying a little over $160 for a group of 4, it's a little upsetting to see that you're treated like a nobody while others in the \"Diamond / VIP line\" get to skip ahead of us \"regular\" folks.  The manager I spoke to said she'd speak to the hostesses about it but the proof will be when we come back.  I drive a cab here in town so I'll ask my customers about their experiences at the buffet before I start recommending the place.\n\n2.  The meat / carving station had a very friendly and very talkative chef / attendant serving to customers.  The problem was as he was talking to each and every one of the people coming thru, the line grew longer and longer for people waiting for prime rib, ribs, lamb chops, brisket, etc..  If the comments would have been short and sweet that would have been one thing but he was flirting with some women in the line as he served them so now what should take a matter of seconds turned into the guy talking with a random patron for 5 minutes while giving her a little of everything.  If there were two people working the station it would have gone so much faster.\n\n*****\n\nAll said, the food at the buffet is above average for now.  It's a good buffet that could use a little tweaking in the way they handle customers.  This is Vegas after all and customer service is the only thing that will keep people coming back.\n\nI guess all I really wanted tonight was a sincere apology and an effort to be made to fix the seating fiasco.  I feel I didn't get that and instead was brushed off.  The three other people in my party felt the same.  \n\nUntil they figure out what works and what doesn't I'm not gonna be the one recommending this buffet in my cab.  \n\n**I'll update this review in the next week or so as I have friends who are coming in to town who want to go here.","review_id":"yfRJQ8Mo5C1_GN4uzSI3Wg","stars":2,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":2,"useful":5,"user_id":"lL-wNa0TKK6LXrlcVmjYrQ","date":"2012-10-03"},{"cool":0,"text":"There is NO better buffet in Vegas!

Don't get me wrong, it's a good buffet and they have a huge selection and most of what I ate was good, but I can get that at any buffet.\n\nFirst, for dinner Sunday  night, it was $50.  We were just getting started on the buffet of buffets (feeling like this was the best way to hit Harrah's Groups buffets) so it was actually a $25 upcharge to the BoB to have dinner at Bacchanal.  Fine.  The line was about 30 minutes to get rung up and then another 15-20 to wait for a table.  Fine.\n\nWe get seated and head for the food parade and that's where I fell flat.  I started with the sushi as I've been wanting cold fresh items on this trip for some reason.  And it was nice that they did have more than just California rolls, including nice tuna ngiri which is what I love.  And, it was good, but I would have liked some soy sauce but there were no containers anywhere to put soy sauce and wasabi in!  In fact, throughout this visit, I found it incredibly hard to use any of the condiments because containers were few and far between.  I found myself using soup bowls for my horseradish, etc.  Crazy.\n\nThey do have a lot of little baskets and containers of things, they just happened to be things that didn't jump out at me, but some were super interesting if you like buckets of mussels, etc. then this is pretty cool.  But, they do the same thing at the Cosmopolitan Wicked Spoon Buffet and I just liked that one better for this type of buffet.\n\nI think that in trying to have SO many dishes, the dishes they have fall flat.  Example is the carving station.  It is seriously LOADED with meats and sausages... pretty much anything you want is there.  I wanted Prime Rib.  For me, that is my buffet staple because they always have it and I rarely order it.  But the Prime Rib was so dry and tough, I was shocked.  That was not acceptable for a buffet of this caliber.\n\nI had the same problem at the dessert bar.  The creme brulee wasn't set and was runny.  It wasn't good.  I was excited about the made to order souffles that they have because that and the crepe station were exactly what I expected them to have, but they only had banana souffles which is the one flavor I do not like, so I had to pass.  But the freshly  made crepes were delish.  Honestly, my favorite part was the dessert and they have a huge selection of mochi!!!  LOVED that.\n\nSo the money to food ratio made this not such a great value to me.  It was a disappointment and I don't expect to eat there again unless I had a complimentary opportunity to try again.  I would be happy at The M and their Studio B Buffet where the food is fantastic AND they have beer and wine included for like $30pp!\n\nIf you are going, I noticed the line went WAY down about 15 minutes before closing.  Might save you some time.","review_id":"xCYyTYEBiEyLmZCe-VRhwA","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"_vy7K2Q9X8p7Jl1OkY_JOQ","date":"2013-09-24"},{"cool":0,"text":"Best buffet in Vegas!!!

Please know that the long lines do not at all effect my rating because I do not wait in any line here and wouldn't for something like this let alone pay extra for a \"line pass\" to skip ahead some. If you are from Vegas like myself, you aren't the type to do that sort of thing and usually know people who can help you avoid such nonsense or have players card perks. The screen said there was a 103 minute wait when we arrived for dinner, so I was very happy that we were escorted right by it and taken to the platinum dining area with no wait. Our drink order was taken right away and our server was great about checking on us. I ordered coffee and he never let my cup go empty and he also was quick to clean up dirty plates. I'd go to one area and get a plate and then pass by that same area later and see something completely different. They are constantly putting out freshly made food, so don't forget to keep your eye out when passing by an area you've already been to.\n\nI liked that they had pizza with thin and thick crust. I thought the pizza had great flavor and some of the best buffet pizza I've had. Some of the pasta dishes were hit and miss, but the lasagna was very good and the guy who makes the pasta custom to order is awesome. I had some linguine and he added garlic and white wine to the sauce per my request and it ended up tasting really good. The salad area had a good variety of things to offer and the veggies were fresh. They have an area with a variety a meats, cheeses and breads along with nuts, roasted peppers and olives that is definitely worth making a stop at. There was a small line for tacos and with good reason. After you get your tacos don't forget to check out the salsas, cheese, sour cream, guac, etc. and also get some of the beans and rice. I didn't care so much for the al pastor taco however the carne asada taco was very good. The guac I added to the tacos tasted fresh and delicious. When I passed back by the taco area, I noticed some nachos getting put out and grabbed some. The nachos came in a small tin pail and had beans, cheese, salsa, sour cream and guac with tortilla chips. I loved these so much that I went back for seconds! Get the nachos! The much talked about sliders here weren't that great, or at least on the night that I tried them. I liked the thick slice of cheese on the burger and the bun was good, but the burger itself was overcooked and dry. I was excited to try the prime rib and it was tender, but seriously lacked flavor which was disappointing. I thought the mashed potatoes were very good and the mac and cheese was good also. The sausages tasted great and while the ribs were big, they weren't big with flavor sadly. One thing I really liked was the fried chicken and onion rings. My hubby came back with a plate of fried rice, steamed dumplings and pepper steak that looked so good I had to go make myself a plate. The pepper steak was a big hit between us both and he went back for seconds. The crepes were ok, I didn't care for how crispy my crepes were. The desserts here are amazing and they have a good selection to choose from, so make room!  The buffet itself isn't the biggest in town, but they make up for that with what is offered. The price for the dinner buffet is more than reasonable considering the types of quality dishes offered.","review_id":"ugJ3NowlR0G0h3bjryc3tQ","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":46,"useful":62,"user_id":"Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA","date":"2017-01-26"},{"cool":0,"text":"We went opening weekend and it was fabulous.

Everything from the red velvet pancakes to the fried chicken baskets was perfection. The dessert section was massive. They took a page out of the Cosmo's book and served everything individually - much more sanitary. All of the chefs behind the glass were talkative and helpful. The manager was checking in with all of the guests as well (granted it was opening weekend). The chairs are pretty hefty lounge-style armchairs which makes it a little difficult to maneuver with a hand full with a plate and your chair was tucked back in while you were gone.","review_id":"3m4Le-jQkBQBJ2DVnHXHzw","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"PIcxwnQUeWHJ67tG5pkWxg","date":"2013-05-26"},{"cool":0,"text":"A really good experience for a buffet visit. It took us about 35 minutes to get through the line and sit at our table, but once we were seated, we were able to get our food fast. Unique serving portions and upscale decor make this a place to visit in Las Vegas. Here is the breakdown of my review:\n\nSERVICE:   The cashier and hostess were pleasant. We got a brief explanation of all the different stations and cuisines available, which was nice, but the place seemed shorthanded. Refills took a while and the clearing of dirty dishes around us was slow. Almost gave them 3 because of it. \n\nFood: Overall, there is tasty food all around. However, the carving station is OUT OF THIS WORLD. They serve up the biggest pieces of beef I have ever seen, including premium cuts like the tomahawk ribeye. If you are a steak lover, you will be pleased. The sushi and Japanese station was great (fresh) and the seafood station was ok.\n\nDesserts: Simply AMAZING. Besides having the desserts you can expect at an upscale buffet,  the have a section just for their unique gelato flavors. Not sure if the ice cream is homemade, but you will find some delicious combinations, like the chocolate/hot pepper, which is sure to amaze your taste buds and blow your mind. \n\nVisit this place if you get a chance.

I tried a piece of a square pizza that turned out to be amazing.  Went to get more at the end of my meal, and was told it was the chef's specialty.  I chatted with him and he said he'd make me a \"personal pizza.\"  15 minutes later I came back to a HUGE pizza just for me.  It was blue cheese, prosciutto, and another meet I'm forgetting.

I understand the days fo the $9.99 buffet are over and I have no issue shelling out $40-$50 for a premium buffet...but when I do so, I expect premium food and service.\n\nHonestly, I didn't find the food to be spectacular, or at least enough so to make me forget about the horrible service.  There were many items I enjoyed throughout my many samplings.  Overall, I was just perplexed at time by the set up and extremely frustrated by the service.  Maybe someone can help me with this one.  You have a long line building for crab legs (rightfully so) but why put the drawn butter at the beginning of the line...with no cups or other dishes to hold said butter.  Should i just lather it on an empty plate?  Upon further review, perhaps the crab legs should have been the START of the line and the butter the end...this would also explain why lemons, tartar sauce, horseradish and cocktail sauce were AFTER the chilled shrimp.  If this is the case, then why isn't there someone directing traffic?  I mean it wouldn't hurt to have people using the buffet the way it was designed instead of lining up the wrong way and getting in the way of the staff trying to go in and out of the kitchen and dodging swinging doors and carts.  The lines were going completely backwards.  You'd expect a place dubbed as the best to operate like a well oiled machine.\n\nAnother perplexing thing is how the line to get in is so incredibly long to get in but then inside the place is half empty and seemingly understaffed.  I'm looking around at waiters standing around, managers setting tables, dirty tables, and I can't get a drink order filled.  Our original waitress disappeared for awhile after serving us initially before I spotted her standing around doing nothing in another section.  I asked two different people and waited roughly 20 minutes for a drink towards the tail end of the meal before we decided to get up and leave.  This was all after we sat around for 10 minutes before a waitress even came by to take the first drink order.  Two beverages in 60+ minutes and nobody walking around filling up waters seems a bit unacceptable.  In addition, nobody came by to clear used dishes and glasses until we were almost forced to turn around and put them on an empty table just to make room.  I mean this seems like Buffet 101 type stuff to me...when people get up to get another plate, you clear the previous plate and/or bring a drink.  I don't know if we caught them at a bad day/time but $52 and a 30 minute wait is a bit too steep for me to run back and find out, especially with other good options down the street.  When comparing to Wicked Spoon in terms of price, food, and service, I would choose Wicked Spoon every time.","review_id":"n0Hlbfk8wP25hYIrIyKpfQ","stars":2,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"mnoe2vwouRADn97dTDkw4A","date":"2013-01-07"},{"cool":0,"text":"The best buffet on the strip.

On the far left side of the buffet was the Asian section, tucked away in the corner that included, Chinese, Vietnamese and sushi, the food was excellent and tasted like it came from a 5 star Asian restaurant. They also had a Mexican, Italian and dessert section. I must warn you not to skip the dessert section and save some room in your stomach for your sweet tooth. The dessert section was designed with glasses all around the top of the dessert island and glass in blue and yellow squares gives it a chic touch. I went to the crepe station where they make your crepe but you personalize it yourself with toppings and different flavors of sauce they leave out. The mini muffins were very sweet and so was the tangerine cake. \n\nThe customer service was excellent and they always refilled my drinks and checked how everything was and the quality of the food.

Once your back you show your time receipt to a lady to wait in line to pay. After paying youd need to get into a line to be sat. Once sat you could get into line to get your food. \n\nFood:  oyesters had pieces of shell in them. Choices of fish were scarce, himachi and salmon thats it. The line for pho and udon was long amd the broths were over boiling to a point where each both tastes the same due to it spilling over. Snow crab was frozen still even after the man boiled it in front of our eyes. Meats were all very salty,  I tried them all. Overall for food. If your paying 60 and waiting for 2 hours to eat, the food better have presentation, have quality product and better taste great.

Things like Chicken&Waffles, Skirt Steak & Eggs, Corned Beef  Hash with a fried Quail Egg, & Lobster Egg Benedict. They also have a good amount of their lunch menu out during breakfast including the meat section, featuring about a dozen or so cuts/meat.. I especially enjoy the prime rib, habanero sausage, and bacon-wrapped lamb. The Asian food section in the back is also open in the morning.. foods like shumai, Pad Thai, sushi, and the Asian soup station(Pho, Ramen, Udon), which are actually pretty decent.\n\nThis buffet has so much to offer.. from the 7 or 8 times we've visited, they've continued to come out with new, impressive options.\nSome of my other highlights: Chilean seabass, broccoli casserole, fried fish, any of the dishes that are topped with a fried egg, Baklava gelato, the salted caramel brownie thing, and the Horchata! \n\nAmbiance: A very clean, modern look with a comfortable setting that gives you a relaxing experience when enjoying your food. The main seating area could be a bit of a maze when going back and fourth but the overall layout is great. The one thing that does bother me is how wide the party-of-2 tables are and how close the tables are to one another. I was literally right next to the lady at the table next to me and further away from my girlfriend sitting across from me. I felt like I had to talk extra loud for my girlfriend to hear me, but soft enough so the next table isn't involuntarily listening to me.\n\nService: Yes, this is a very popular buffet but they've come up with the genius idea of having a kiosk system where they text you when your table is almost ready. It is a very attractive idea because you don't get that discouraging feeling of seeing that crazy long line. It also gives you the opportunity to go do other things while waiting(gamble) :). All the staff members are very welcoming and polite.. quick servers and helpful cooks. The price of this buffet is a little bit more than all the others, but you will definitely get your money's worth every time. \n\nTips: If you're coming for breakfast, try to come at the end of the breakfast time(10-10:30ish) so you can get a taste of the lunch items that come out at 11am. Take your time, try to get in all the options they offer and enjoy.

It was probably as bad as going to Golden Coral or Ruby's. It just wasn't good, very poor quality and very overpriced. \nI decided I would never go again.\n\nOne thing I will tell you - I am not big on buffets. I don't like that people can touch the same things you're touching and you don't know where people have placed their hands. I eat out a lot and I can handle it with the restaurant employees because I don't see them making my food. At buffets, I see everyone touching everything or even putting their hands in something. I can't handle it. \n\nThe #1 thing about this buffet is, almost everything is separated or served to you. High. Five.\n#2 - the food is VERY good. I would say that this is the best buffet on the strip. I've been to most of them on the strip because when families come to town, they love buffets. This one trumps all. \nThe food is very well cooked, not over cooked and served very fresh. I love how they serve hot crab legs to you so they're not dried out or too cold. \nI had the pizza, lamb, blue cheese wedge salad, Asian BBQ Ribs, Prime Rib, mac & cheese, green beans, chicken florentine, crab legs, crab wontons, I ate a lot. \nBut, my favorite was the crepes. I'm not big on sweets, but I looooooooove crepes. \nI had her drizzle nutela on it and topped it with whipped cream, strawberries and caramel bananas...god, it was delicious.\n\nThe buffet is pricey, but if you're going to indulge, it's worth it.

It was only a couple weeks after it opened and my god, the line is ridiuclously long! I came around 6:00 hoping that the line wouldn't be too bad but upon my arrival, the line was snaking around like it was Disneyland or something.\n\nNot only was the line super long but the it was moving ridiculously slowwwww. I swear I was standing in the same place for at least 10 minutes before moving an inch. -_- I'm normally a patient person but just the way the line was moving it was going to take at least 2+ hours just to get seated.  After about a good 45 minutes, I said F*CK it and I decided to shell out the extra $15 bucks per person for the express.  Thankfully, NO ONE was at there and I literally got seated within 5 minutes. \n\nSo, besides paying $50+ per person for this meal, I actually had a GREAT time! I immediately saw all the different selections and my mood quickly turned from hangry (hungry + angry) to super happy! (sappy?) Anyways, when you first arrive inside, you'll notice the long selection of seafood in the front.  I was quite impressed with all the mussels, oysters, and crabs that you get to choose from.  There is a guy in the back who can steam them for you too if you're not a fan of raw seafood.  At first, I thought that was pretty much it but I quickly learned that the buffet stretched allllllll the way down the room.  It was a non-stop line of food! I was very impressed with their selection.\n\nEverything tasted amazing! Well, everything except their pizza. I know, why would I get pizza at a fancy buffet like Bacchanal when they have steak and seafood?! I really enjoyed my meal.  I would say it was TOTALLY worth spending that extra $15.  Ceviche? Bomb. Lobster bisque? Bomb.  Crab fritters? ALL BOMB.  The bf also really liked many of their selections as well.  Definitely try a little bit of everything.  You'll find a mass amount of food here that you'll like. \n\nI think Caesar's did a great job of making sure that they offered a vast selection of food for their buffet.  They have everything from ramen to pho to typical American side dishes. I definitely think Bacchanal has topped Wicked Spoon. Food and service was way better than WS! The servers were super attentive when it came to refilling our waters and beverages and pretty much I had a really smooth good meal. Definitely a must try when you come!

Located near the pool area in Caesar's, this buffet is most definitely a fancy schmancy buffet.  Most people don't think fancy schmancy and buffet belong in the same sentence, because when they think buffet, they think Golden Corral.  Since we were here during the week of New Year's, they still had their \"holiday\" pricing for the buffet, which really just gives them a reason to jack up the prices.  So, including tax, we paid $95 total for breakfast/brunch.  Yes, that's outrageous, but it's Vegas and we wanted to try it.\n\nThe decor of this buffet is really nice, and it certainly doesn't feel like a buffet when you walk in.  You see many items being cooked fresh, which I have a lot of appreciation for.  That's something you don't see too often at a buffet.  They had fresh seafood, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, etc.  Basically, anything you wanted, they had it.  This included chicken and waffles, and yes, freshly carved bacon!!  Everything I tried was really good.  I tried to sample a little bit of everything, and there wasn't anything that I truly didn't care for.  Their dessert station was excellent, as they had homemade crepes, gelato, cookies, cake, donuts, cake, etc.  I thought it was all very good, but as with most buffets, eventually you encounter the law of diminishing returns.\n\nSo, all in all, would I come here again?  Yes.  Would I be rushing back to pay these exorbitant prices?  No.  I can get a very similar experience at Wynn or Aria, for a fraction of the cost.  Either way, I'm glad we tried it.  It's officially checked off the Vegas list.","review_id":"0aOd8gjlNFCm1pytJKmYfg","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":3,"user_id":"MpQ8K-NFcIB1gvNUwnAYgQ","date":"2015-01-05"},{"cool":0,"text":"We came here on a Thursday at 2pm.  I had read horror stories about the lines so I walked by around 1 pm and there was no line.  When we went back to eat at 2 pm, still no line.  When we left around 3pm, still no line.  So either the line stories are exaggerations or we got lucky.  Either way, I'll take it.\n\nPrice per person for lunch (with the casino rewards card) = $31.99.  Dinner was $44.99 per person.  We were seated at the same time as one other guy who was dining alone.  What I found interesting is his receipt had \"TIP\" stamped on it in bold black ink, so I assume he left a tip on his card when he paid.  We didn't.  The hostess sat both of us with one table in between us.  The server came over and looked at his receipt and hardly said a word to him.  She came and looked at our receipt and all of sudden started the spiel about where everything was located, things to look for, and reminded us to save room for dessert.  She was very prompt in refilling drinks and clearing plates.  At the end of course we left a tip, but I kinda wonder if she blew the other guy off because he'd already left a tip whereas she had to work for ours.  Who knows?  Just an interesting observation.\n\nAnyway, on to the important stuff - the food!  We were there for lunch so there's a more limited selection of items but there were still an absolute ton of things to choose from.  We started at the far end at the asian section and worked our way back toward the seafood section (where we stopped because neither of us eat seafood).  My favorite thing in the asian section were the pot stickers.  Crunchy outer shell and very tasty.  In the salad section (yes, I know, who bothers with salad at a buffet?) I found the greek salad to be really good.  I would have eaten more but even I was a little concerned about the fact that I was eating salad at a buffet.  There was a whole section of sliced meats and cheeses that we did not try.  In the Italian section I was disappointed because they were out of the lasagna and I never made it back over there to see if they had made more, but the meatballs were SO good!!  At the Mexican station they will make tacos for you on a rotating grill.  You can have carne asada, pork or chicken.  I liked the chicken best, my husband prefered the pork.  We skipped the breads and soups.  My husband tried the prime rib and enjoyed it.  They had little baskets of fried food - fried chicken, french fries, tater tots, wings, onion rings, etc.  Everything we tried there was good.  On either side of the meat carving station you will find veggies and sides - broccoli, asparagus, mashed potatoes, fingerling potatoes, mac and cheese, etc.  There was honestly only one thing I tried that I did not like and that was the wagyu beef sliders.  The only reason I didn't like them is because they were pretty rare and I just can't handle meat that isn't well done.\n\nOur server wasn't kidding when she said to save room for dessert... man oh man do they make some good crepes!  They make them to order and you can put your own toppings on!  They have a fresh berry mix, strawberries, caramelized bananas, chocolate sauce, caramel sauce, fresh whipped cream, etc.  I almost wish I had started with dessert - the crepe was so good!  They also had mini cupcakes, different types of cakes, cake pops, a chocolate lava cake (yum!), and a bunch of different types of ice cream.  I couldn't try it all and I was so upset with the limitations of my stomach.  \n\nNext time I come to Vegas I will make sure I have a very empty stomach before coming to Bacchanal.  We tried one other buffet while in town, down on Fremont Street.  It was half the price but about 1/16th the quality of food.  My advice is suck it up and pay the money - the food is worth it!","review_id":"MRIde6h7Mu6l8FMZ9VmUUQ","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"zbahX7xiLbjWWM4_L43lhg","date":"2013-04-08"},{"cool":4,"text":"Meh.\nHonestly, the meal was OK, but the price made it go down a star.

I guess it's the same for all great buffets, they can't stay that great forever.\n\nWhat was good:\nShrimp cocktail--the shrimp was perfectly cooked and were huge.\nLamb chops--very tender, not much fat and also perfectly cooked.\nThe guy in charge of the carving station--I think his name is David. He's a very friendly tall black guy and he's always smiling.

The little rubber things they give you to hold the plates were unnecessary, seeing as hot the plates were not even hot enough to keep the food warm by the time we got back to our table.\n\nThe fruit section was pretty much non existent. Only watermelon, pineapple, and cantaloupe. I def missed the strawberries, not even any in the dessert section covered in chocolate.\n\nI just can't help but compare this place with the buffet at M Resort.

We all skipped lunch for this and were all starving unhappy people.\n\nSERVICE - We all got our table and grabbed our plates of food. Oh look! No utensils.

In fact, I thought it was one of the best buffets in town.\n\nFast forward to today, minus the Yelp Elite treatment I got to see the typical consumer experience and I was sorely disappointed. The major issue with the place is the price: $50 bucks, but Ill get to that part later.\n\nThe food quality has really dropped off recently. We visited on a Thursday for dinner, and after waiting in like for about 30 min (which I heard is a short wait) We got in, shelled out $200+ for 4 people and went off get some food. Unfortunately, Bacchanal has fallen into the ways of many other buffets in town. Much of the food sat under heating lamps. The once crisp pizzas are now soggy and poorly replenished. The carving station now serves up a 50/50 portion of fat and meat. The carvers give little attention to giving you the best cut. The watermelon/feta cheese dish which I adored is gone (maybe just on the day I went). Souffle station? not open, sushi? a mess. Most of the cheese/meats were gone. Chicken fingers were replaced with dry and over-fried chicken wings. And I still don't know why they don't place ranch/dipping sauces in the vicinity. Not really up to the caliber of what I once experienced. \n\nThe service was abysmal. After our initial visit, we had to flag down other servers for refills. We never got any of our condiments, and we watched as the dirty plates piled up on our table. We weren't the only ones, while waiting in the long line for the carving station I saw other diners place their used plates on other tables to clear up space on theirs. Really sad. And speaking of lines, I am almost convinced that the buffet is set-up to maximize the wait for the good stuff. The lines to the carving station and seafood are lonnnng. Expect to wait 15min to get a serving of fatty prime rib or some luke-warm crab. bleh...\n\nNow this all brings me to bigger issue: value. At $50 I think this place is outrageous. Keep in mind that they have upped the price from what used to be $40.. and it does not include free drinks! Other buffets in town (IE: The M buffet) at least includes unlimited beer and wine, Bacchanal wants even more $$$. They do at least offer a pretty big wine list. At $50+ a pop you are approaching fine dining prices, places in CP like Mesa Grill will get you a lot more for your money. Better quality food, better experience, and definitely better service. Now don't get me wrong, Bacchanal is a pretty good buffet. It offers up stuff you can't find anywhere else but its simply not worth it. You get a wide selection of average food.\n\nCouple of bright spots: \n\nThey now serve up mochi woo!\nStreet taco station is as good as ever!\nPlace looks amazing, best looking buffet in town.\nDesert station is on point, every dessert you could want.\n\nBut be warned: you will be leaving feeling full, but not satisfied.","review_id":"m9ZlaEPJ2jkNvV3iUDJGxA","stars":2,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":2,"user_id":"ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw","date":"2013-01-31"},{"cool":3,"text":"4th of July weekend recap:\n*Waited 1.5 hours on a Friday night to get seated.\n*Paid 60 bucks.

Def. avoid the prime dinner time of 6-8 if you don't want to wait.\n* Jacking up the price during holidays- well I suppose this isn't their fault, gotta make up for the tons of customers to feed I guess...","review_id":"535OePGP3zz1r_9ujrnDfw","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":2,"useful":5,"user_id":"AzN4B04BxO5bV1lvSou8Qg","date":"2013-08-29"},{"cool":1,"text":"After reading the hype once Caesar's Palace decided to upgrade Cafe Lago, I made a point on my next trip to Vegas to visit Bacchanal Buffet, which happened to be for breakfast ($25 with a Total Rewards card).  Overall, I liked the modern feel of the space with plenty of tables for large groups (8+) and somewhat uncharacteristic lounge music playing in the background.  The food, though, was pretty standard (and bordering on outright disappointing) in terms of breakfast/brunch buffets.\n\nTo start with, Total Rewards Diamond and Seven Stars members get little signs as they are walked through the restaurant that are placed at their table.  While perhaps off-putting to an outsider, it is interesting to see how you are more likely to see the elderly, stingy video poker playing couple or upper-middle aged overweight blackjack/craps player eating by themselves than, for instance, Jay Gatsby in a tuxedo.  It goes to show that gambling in Las Vegas doesn't look quite like what the mailers picture it to be.\n\nI digress.  As I mentioned before, the breakfast food was pretty standard with the highlight being the carving station featuring brisket, ham, and a variety of what they termed \"artisanal sausages.\"  Mind you, the sausages themselves--which usually had some extra spices or other ingredients mixed in--were just okay.  \n\nOther sections of the buffet try to put out individual servings of popular dishes but end up failing miserably.  Corned beef hash in a 2-inch bowl with a tiny egg (nice touch) but a scant few traces of corned beef among the potato shreds was a disgrace.  Chicken and waffles as a quarter Belgian waffle and a chicken wing is just wrong.  The mini-pancakes were dry, though they did a slightly better job with the French toast.  The Asian section had some steamed pork buns and basic Chinese food.  I would have loved to have seen some freshly cooked fish choices for those looking for more of a Japanese-style breakfast.\n\nOn the plus side, I did like the large selection of juices served in individual-sized glass milk bottles.  It's more visually appealing and keeps the crowds moving faster than a Minute Maid dispenser or a couple of large carafes for self-service.\n\nWhile the overall environment (i.e., everything except the food) is top-notch, in my opinion, the breakfast offerings at Bellagio and Paris's buffets are superior.  In reality, though, if your level of play starts to get items taken off the hotel bill, your choice of breakfast buffet should be dictated by where you're staying or doing most of your gambling.  I don't think any buffet in Vegas is so much better than the others as to overcome the presumptive choice of free food.","review_id":"J6sSSX7YKhQuonsPqKPTBQ","stars":2,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":1,"user_id":"kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ","date":"2013-05-12"},{"cool":1,"text":"I was really excited to come to the Ceasars Buffet because I heard they redid their layout and interior.  Some were saying that this buffet is the new up and coming buffet- next best to Wicked Spoon at Cosmo.  I came on a Sunday night with some our of town family and some locals and we were in line for a good hour at least.  That was the wait before we paid then there was another 20 minute wait after we paid.  We were seated and realized that the line for the seafood and the American/ Mexican food area (most of the main dish meats) had a HUGE line.  Sad to say that people in our group had to wait in line for at least an hour to get their seafood.  There was no rhyme or reason for a line that long with no good organization of the crowd.  I don't even know if some people knew they were standing in line for (you couldn't really preview the food if you didn't wait in the massive line).  We were lucky to have had four people in our party, so we divided and conquered (two people in the lines and one person taking food from each of them and bringing it back to the table.  The food itself was pretty good, but for time lost that could have been spent enjoying a meal together this place gets only two stars.  Most other buffets I've gone to have had nothing close to the chaos/ waiting like this place did.

Flash forward to a Tuesday evening. There was still a 45-minute wait and the price was $55 for dinner on a weeknight. Fortunately, we were given a ticket to bypass the wait time, but I was still surprised by the price compared to Wicked Spoon. But, I convinced myself that I had to try Bacchanal at least once before forming judgment. \n\nThe \"#1 rated buffet in Vegas\" failed to live up to its hype on several fronts. Let's start with the good. You're basically paying the price tag for the amazing seafood and carving station options. The crab legs/claws were some of the best I've had at a buffet and I really went to town on the jumbo shrimp. They also had oysters on the half shell, which were mediocre. Several amuse-bouches included a good seafood ceviche, oyster shooter, and a salmon spread. Another winner was the scallops Rockefeller. I found the brioche crust to be perfect. For meats, the prime rib was bloody excellent, and I loved the rack of lamb. Head to the Mexican station to grab freshly-squeezed guava, pineapple, strawberry, or horchata juice served in a bottle on ice. \n\nWhere does this buffet fail? Pretty much everything else. There were some pretty bad dishes including an extremely dry cod and awfully salty BBQ ribs. But, I really didn't like the offering of sushi, pizza, and desserts. If you're paying top dollar, should you really be serving pizza sitting under a heat lamp? How about something different like flatbread? The sushi was pretty much like any other buffet sushi - dried out rice with old-tasting fish. I liked the ice cream offerings, but all the other desserts and pastries tasted stale and dry. \n\nForget the stupid ticketing system and heavy wait times. Forget the expensive price. Forget all the disappointing food. I'll take Wicked Spoon or a nice steak dinner any day.","review_id":"S-mlXB4_lEp-weNCvstNRw","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":3,"useful":6,"user_id":"fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw","date":"2014-10-26"},{"cool":0,"text":"Love this buffet!

Another chance to get fat from a Vegas buffet.  Finally checked this buffet off the list from the ones to try.\n\nLocated near the back left of Caesars Palace, there are signs that direct you there passing your through the casino to tickle your temptations to play some table games while you are walking there.  We arrived around 6:15 and got a ticket, per the request of the attendant.  (She should just put up a sign because she was telling everyone to get a ticket).  Walked around the casino for about 5 minutes and was texted to come back.  Got there just to get in line... I don't get that but the line was ridiculously slow.  Either way, we waited and waited and got in around 30 minutes later.  Not ridiculous but I was under the assumption that when you get texted to go back, you can just walk up and pay and head right in.  Anyways, for $55 (You can save a dollar from joining Total Rewards), you are presented with stations and stations of food.  From Asian, to Italian, to Mexican, to American BBQ, to Seafood, and finally dessert.  The choices are pretty much endless.  The highlights of the night which I recommend:\n\nBeef Pho:  Pho from a non-Vietnamese place sounds pretty shady and makes your skeptical but the broth was pretty deep and but not completely authentic.  Sweeter than what I would usually have but tasty nonetheless.\n\nRaw Bar:  Oysters on the half-shell, shucked right in front of you, Massive shrimp cocktail, ceviche, king crab legs, and baked scallops.  SEE FOOD GALORE.  You can't pretty much spend your whole meal there if  you wanted to.\n\nStreet Tacos: Cooked on a revolving flattop you can choose from Chicken, Carnitas or  Asada  with corn tortillas.  They are made to order and topped with onions, guac, and cilantro.\n\nAguas Frescas:  An assortment of drinks from hibiscus, to guava and horchata. They seem to be made fresh and placed into small bottles for your to try.  I'd prefer to have them in smaller bottles so I don't waste them if I didn't like it.\n\nDesserts:  Tons of ice cream and sorbet flavors, vanilla or chocolate mochi, macarons, carrot cakes, cheesecake, egg tarts, and made to order crepes.  Remember to save your stomach for this (or just fill your stomach with the rest of the buffet and reserve your separate dessert stomach for this station)  All were really good.  Some were a bit sweet but they were pretty balanced for the most part.  I wish they had bread pudding like at the Bellagio but the other dessert make up for it.\n\nThe best I have had in Vegas in a while.  Since most buffets are pretty pricey right now, the $55 damage doesn't feel too bad when you compare it to the others and the selection and quality you get at Bacchanal.  The wait is still a bummer but if you are a baller or get there early, the wait isn't too bad and probably worth it.

It has always been my #1 favorite hotel in Vegas, but the truth was it was getting pretty dumpy...and basically coasting on its legendary name. Thankfully, hotel brass is now on a mission to make Caesars a 5-star resort, which includes revamping customer service, renovating rooms, and replacing the SAD, nasty-ass old buffet with this fabulous masterpiece!\n\nThe name hearkens back to Caesars' old Bacchanal restaurant, the legendary scene of many a debauched meal partaken by fat plutocrats reclined on pillows, Wine Goddesses pouring the finest booze down their gullets. This being 2012, they toned down the excess just a TAD...so no more pillows, and no more Wine Goddesses...but in every other respect, this place is a true bacchanal! All that's missing is a vomitorium -- for now, you'll have to make do with discreetly puking into the potted plants.\n\nYou'll most definitely want to puke when visiting this buffet -- there's SO MUCH EXCELLENT FOOD, there's no way you can try everything without doing so. The chefs behind the Bacchanal visited every single buffet in Vegas (EVERY SINGLE ONE...even the crappy Arizona Charlie's ones, LOL) to suss out the competition...and then they proceeded to design a buffet that kicks every other buffet in town's ass -- hands down!! Even the vaunted M Resort Buffet!!! \n\nFirst off, beer and wine are included with dinner -- and whatever wine they pour is pretty damn good, so drink up! The selection of food is GREAT -- a fantastic sushi/sashimi spread, dim sum, tons of Asian salads and oddities. Plenty of glistening roasted animals hanging on hooks, waiting to be sliced up and gobbled down by salivating patrons. Fantastic salad bar, with fancy hi-class accouterments. FABULOUS charcuterie, with stinky cheeses and a variety of cured meats and dried fruits. Artisanal honey straight from a proudly displayed honeycomb -- with different spices, like star anise and vanilla bean, added to the various jars (the honey pairs GREAT with the Stilton bleu cheese). Hand-made tortillas at the Mexican station...individual baked lasagnas and zitis at the Italian station...a GINORMOUS seafood selection with every sort of shellfish imaginable, and a fine spread of greasy, lard-assed \"comfort food\" for the Amurricans in the house. My only complaint is that their middle Eastern selection is limited to hummus, tabbouleh, couscous and dolmades...and there is no Indian selection. But seriously, I couldn't fit any more anyway, so I forgive them! Oh, and the desserts are fabulous and WAY more varied than at other buffets -- it was like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory! I'd never tried a REAL marshmallow before...and I'm here to tell you, THEY ARE DELICIOUS! \n\nThe decor is clean and modern, with lots of classy food-as-art design flourishes. The background music is modern and the perfect tempo for eating -- fast enough to keep you pushing on through your miserable fullness, yet mellow enough to allow for a relaxed feeling.\n\nThere is a large private dining room in the back, perfect for wedding receptions or private high-roller parties -- in fact, the room includes an 80\" TV and will soon feature a karaoke system for those krazy hi-rolling Asian parties! I can't *WAIT* to get invited to (or crash) one of THOSE!!!\n\nUgh, I can't write about this anymore because I am still reeling from my visit, and just threw up a little in my mouth. But take it from me -- this is a GREAT buffet!!! Its fabulous vibe of excess and decadence fit in perfectly with the whole Roman Empire shtick at Caesars...so if you really want to experience the glory and bounty of America, head here at once.

Or lots of seafood. Just don't expect Top Chefs to be under those white hats. If you find yourself tossing around dried up or overheated pieces of food, just skip to the next station. \n\nI will say that what might make Bacchanal different is that they have chefs at every station who serve up the dishes in small batches so things seem to be fresher than what you're used to at a buffet. \n\nDon't go for a quiet intimate atmosphere or experience. Go before hitting up the club to hype you up for it. It's that kind of vibe. Busy. Cool staff. Clean plates. Pretty bright lights and is it just me or do you ever feel like ballroom dancing on the buffet floors? \n\nMake the most of your entrance fee. Eat. And then eat some more.

I am genuinely impressed. I went for lunch last month and didn't have the best experience and I posted a review reflecting my disappointment. The manager Stephanie contacted me and asked me to give them another try. My work schedule is busy this time of year and I cancelled and changed times on her several times and would not have been surprised if she just said to forget it but she didn't. I had a last min change and phoned her on fri, St. Patricks day and said we'd be there in a couple hours. The entire staff from the first cashier you meet to our excellent waiter and everyone in-between was gracious and professional. Our drinks were always refilled and the table cleaned while we were getting more food. As for the food, it really is an amazing display  over several stations. One of the things that really impressed me was how they manage to keep everything looking good, clean, orderly and not picked over. They put out small portions - many in individual little pots and pans and they do this over and over through out the night. The result is even on a fairly busy night, everything looks good and crispy food is crispy, soft food is fresh etc. They really do a hell of a job with that. The food itself? Again I'm impressed. We had many trips to the food stations and took tiny portions of each and everything we tried was good. Standouts were the chicken and waffles, portugese sausage, corned beef, dolmas, crab legs, truffle gnocchi and spicy thai beef. We tried so many items and really only scratched the surface, the selection is insane. Then there's desert... save room because the selection is good and again, a huge  variety to satisfy anyone, even sugar free selections.  As for the room itself, very comfortable and well thought out. You don't feel like you're in a cafeteria. The way the food stations are laid out and the flow and bends of the room break it up and make good sense. Also, the way the food stations are laid out, there are no long lines. You can just graze around and grab what looks good to you. There was a bit of a line up at the meat carving area but with half a dozen dinosaur size roasts, hams, ribs, briskets etc it didn't seem unusual and it moved fast.

Definitely the best buffet I've been to in a while. \n\nThey have kiosks like disneyland that gives you a time frame of when you can come back and get in line to buy tickets. They've also have alcohol that is also unlimited for an extra fee. Why waste room in your stomach though when there's ALL that food?! I'll just go over quick highlights.\n\nI had a ton of king crab legs but so many were still frozen and after a few I gave up. They also had a ton of frozen stone crab claws (they've must've been because they're not in season right now) but it tasted pretty good. Melted butter constantly being stirred and lemon was a great accompaniment. \n\nTheir lamb is unbelievable, the best I've ever had. PERFECTLY cooked, moist, tender and seasoned. The sliders were also unbelievably good. I've paid $18 for a tiny mini 3 slider dish at a \"happening\" restaurant at Santa Monica 3rd St Promenade but this was incomparably better. Prime rib was also above average but that's expected at a place like this. \n\nFor desserts, definitely get the house-made gelato. I had cosmo's wicked spoon back to back to this place and this place's stracciatella and chocolate is phenomenal and much better. Their chocolate tastes much more authentic (if that makes any sense) than any other place.

The high price made me take advantage of the food I usually don't like to spend per plate... which is mostly CRAB LEGS. I must have had 4 or 5 plates of crab legs. There are cold crab legs as well as hot crab legs fresh off the boiling pot, which I preferred. I also really enjoyed the brisket (which was perfectly cooked!).\n\nOne cool tip - go have a late lunch and pay the lunch price. Why? Soon enough it will be dinner time, and they will be putting out dinner items, some of which are very special (bone marrow, anyone)?\n\nOverall, I had a good time here.

In fact, it was pretty darn good. \n\nPROS:\n-It's beautiful! Everything is absolutely gorgeous.\n-The people cooking the food are all delightful and super helpful.\n-The food itself really is delicious. There is something for everyone--from a big carnivorous meat station, to everything Asian, to Mexican street tacos. I didn't have a single item that was subpar. \n-They are very gluten-free friendly! In a city where I was hard-pressed to find gf goodies, Bacchanal gets it right. Especially at the desserts! (Just ask.)\n\n CONS:\n-It's expensive. There's no way on earth I'm ever going to eat enough to even remotely cover the cost.\n-I didn't think the service staff was very attentive. I definitely needed refills more often than they cared to stop by. And you tip when you pay--before eating... so they knew I had tipped well.

Bacchanal's is probably one of the more popular buffets on the Strip, so I was really looking forward to stuffing my face with delicious food for a couple hours.\n\nWe arrived around 3:00-3:30 p.m. and they were setting up for dinner. The wait time was ridiculously long (almost two hours) so we decided to put our names down and do a bit of shopping at the Forum Shops (I highly suggest doing this so that you're not getting too hangry). We came back just before 5:00 p.m. and the line was much shorter and we were seated and eating by 5:30 p.m. They give you 2 hours to eat but I'm sure if you stay longer, they wouldn't notice ;)\n\nThe buffet cost us $65/person so I had huge expectations on the food quality and selection. I can't say that there was anything that really stood out to me, as far as the selection goes, but the food quality was definitely 5 STARS. I wasn't really wow'd by anything that I tried but I will say that the seafood was extremely fresh - I loved the shrimp cocktail and crab legs. Just to give you an idea of the types of food, we had: pulled pork, beef sliders, tacos (made to order), nachos, meatballs, mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, fried rice, sushi rolls, prime rib, marinated shrimp, shrimp cocktail, grilled salmon, and crab legs.\n\nI'm not much of a buffet person so perhaps Bacchanal's was wasted on me but for the price, I was just expecting a bit more. However, the seafood and dessert are worth the trip if you haven't tried Bacchanal's yet! Maybe I should go back for breakfast or lunch on my next trip but for now, 3 STARS.","review_id":"53sox7ejhRi539O6sHiJPQ","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":2,"useful":7,"user_id":"3HHLpfU7q4HoREEOXtt7pw","date":"2016-03-16"},{"cool":1,"text":"We went there on a Monday night pretty long line it took about 25minutes to get in .

Prime rib?  boo yah dawgie dawg.\n\nAsian food was pretty good for buffet style.   The sushi rice was packed in although I think their mixture for making sticky rice was a little tooooo sticky since the rolls would clump together.  Sushi in general fine although not as good in choice as sushi buffets but made up in the plating and a few choice things that you usually can't get in buffets like temaki rolls.\n\nThey actually made a go at soup dumplings which I was definitely interested in.  It's by no means Din Tai Fung, but they were pretty yummy considering.  I think they packed them in little tin foil platters just so they could hold the warmth that's needed and have a little of the soup in them.\n\nDidn't have the crab legs, but I will say that pre-cut crab legs are a good idea in theory, but less great in reality.   It's still hard to crack without a nutcracker.\n\nYou can actually make things to order which is definitely a HUGE plus for this place.\n\nAlso, a huge miss for most buffet goers was the special salads (watermelon and feta cheese) and the prosciutto.   I think that in general it scares the general populace because it's different from what you expect in a buffet.\n\nDamned good coffee.  That's all you can really say about that.\n\nDesserts looked awesome.  I can't really say how they tasted since I'm not a big fan of desserts in general.\n\nService was excellent and the logistics of opening a place like that has got to be a nightmare.   So I was happy to see that drinks were taken care of and waiters were always on top of their game.   Curious to see if 6 months to a year from now, if that would still be the case.\n\nOverall, it's a great buffet to check out.

If you don't have one, make sure you visit the Player's Card Booth to sign up!  You will get a few dollars off of your buffet.  I got the mimosa buffet and the total came out to be $40 on a weekend.\n\nThe seating inside is made to make you feel like it is spacious and open.  The beautiful blue glass decoratively placed throughout the restaurant makes the restaurant look very modern and clean.\n\nFOOD QUALITY:\nThere is A LOT of variety here. For my very very particular parents, they could not stop raving about how wonderful the Asian section of the buffet was.  For myself, I could not resist the fried chicken (fried chicken, i love you!!) pho, and desserts. There seems to be something for everyone here - desserts, seafood, juices, red velvet pancakes, fries, tator tots, breakfast foods, sausages and other meats, italian food, mexican food, salads, noodles, sushi, and other Asian dishes.\n\nSome of the more memorable dishes:\n*There was actually meat on the crab legs and they tasted fresh!\n*The skin of the fried chicken was absolutely delicious!  The chicken also was super tender.\n* LOVED the noodle station.  *TIP:  Don't miss the noodle station! They serve pho!  The broth was delicious, the noodles were tender - one of the best pho I have had.\n* Dim sum - Ha gow is my favorite dim sum dish and they really got it right!  The shrimp inside was tender, tasty, and fresh!\n* Chow mein was amazing!  I had to go for seconds - packed with flavor!\n* I kept getting the coffee - it was so good and paired perfectly with my dessert.\n\nSERVICE:\nWhat sets Bacchanal Buffet apart from the other buffets on the strip is the service.  From the moment we sat down, our waitress was SUPER accommodating and on top of it!  She kept our coffee and the tea coming and came back very frequently to take away our dishes.  You will notice that it is not just the waitresses/waiters but the entire staff of Bacchanal.  You guys have it together and what a breath of fresh air it is to see!  Even those that are serving you from behind the buffet line are smiley and ready to help.  It truly made our experience here that much better!\n\nOVERALL:\nI have found my new favorite buffet on the Vegas strip.  Because of my wonderful experience here, I definitely have Bacchanal as a required stop to visit on my list whenever I come back to Vegas.  If you haven't come here yet, what are you waiting for?

The first time I tried to eat here for brunch they told me to come back in three hours.  Whhattt?  Well now that I have eaten here I can say I went, and ate and prob won't eat here again.  Pluses for their ticket system that cuts down on the frustrating standing in line experience.\n\nThe seafood was average.  Yes, there were crab legs. And yes, you can get them STEAMED in the Asian section.  There were also oysters (not so good), mussels, ceviche, shrimp and shellfish in various sauces.  The seafood didn't rock my world.\nTheir were some smaller individual sized food like wagyu beef burgers and sea bass.  The sea bass with bok choy was actually one of my fav stand out dishes.  Totally unexpected, but the dim sum in the Asian section was perfectly steamed and delicious (and they wrapper of their hargow didn't stick or break when you tried to eat it).

The Alaskan crab legs you can get at most Las Vegad buffets but the rock crab claws I haven't seen. The reason why I was dissatisfied is because they don't have crab claw crackers.

We didn't have to get drinks as we had fat tuesdays coming in.\n\nThey have from chinese to american to mexican food so you can't go wrong if you are only into one group of food. I personally loved the mexican type of food they had here where there was a station where I could get forever tacos and they actually make the meat fresh for you and it was VERY GOOD. If i wasn't defeated, I would have got 3-4 more tacos... :p \n\nThey have a bunch of ice creams/sorbets, crepes, cakes, and even mochi. Just go all out people because I had a great time enjoying all the types of food they had here. \n\nI say...from my last time experience that this is my favorite buffet now.","review_id":"9-RPJcwpyGTfCtbKMTX87g","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":3,"user_id":"SqjP1cV8JwDdN0K9QULzog","date":"2013-08-05"},{"cool":3,"text":"3.5 stars\n\nMaybe my expectations were too high? I've heard great reviews of Bacchanal so my excitement level was off the roof when we came this past Saturday evening. Arrived at 5:00pm and the wait was already 1.5 hours for a party of 5! We called earlier in the day to see if there was a separate line for Total Reward - Platinum cards but the lady advised us there wasn't. We asked the hostess one more time just to make sure and sure enough, there IS a quicker line for Platinum card holders which cut our wait time to about 10 minutes. Woo Hoo!\n\nThe only thing that's a bang for your buck is the stone crab & king crab legs! Better eat a lot to get your moneys worth. The biggest downfall for the buffet was the amount of sodium in most of the dishes... even the king crab legs from the mass amount of salt they boiled with the crab. We drank so much water during and after our visit. Ribs were really dry and the pho broth had almost no flavor.\n\nHuge variety of asian food (including pho, ramen, udon), charcuterie, taco station (which ran out of pastor by dinner time), sushi, etc. Huge dessert section filled with macrons, made to order crepes, chocolate covered strawberries, cupcakes, flan, tiramisu, carrot cake, etc. If you want variety, this buffet has the largest selection I've seen at a buffet, but it doesn't justify the $52 dinner price.\n\nOur service throughout the entire stay was great, thanks to Rosa. Be sure to order your drinks (i.e. soda, tea) with your server, otherwise there are some selections of juice prepped in bottles by the taco station.","review_id":"m8GSXrph6tOX5lJ-8NdZVw","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":3,"user_id":"DT5JuPKzBEyJCN3EwZV9KQ","date":"2015-06-29"},{"cool":2,"text":"Easily one of THE best buffets in Vegas. \n\nThe wait is almost always over an hour if not more so be prepared.

I never really seek out buffets, but when tourist come I will oblige and indulge.\n\nJust a note that a few of the pictures show a price list when it first opened and it is NOT accurate. The profile picture is a outdated price list. \n\nThis is the cost (currently) as follows:\n\nBreakfast (Mon - Fri, 7 a.m. - 11 a.m.): $25.99\nBrunch (Sat - Sun, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $40.99\nLunch (Mon - Fri, 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $32.99\nDinner (3 p.m. - 10 p.m.): $45.99 on weekdays, $50.99 on weekends\n\nOne thing about this place is that it is sleek and modern and was very well designed and the music selection contemporary downtempo type stuff. Of course we came for the food and the buffet was nicely spread out and nothing was looking old and dried out. We came around 4ish on a monday so it wasn't busy and had no line. That sometimes is a cause for concern that they wouldn't rotate out the lunch out fast enough, but everything was fresh by that time. I wouldn't want to wait hours in a line to eat either and would probably greatly change my opinion of this place. I rarely think anything is worth standing around 1-2 hours so I will go before rush times. \n\nI got a little bit from various savory stations among several rounds and nothing was bad. Even at some other higher end buffets I've had some misses I did not eat which did not occur here. Most ranged from good to very good with only two OK items (fried chicken could be juicier but had good breading, ceviche a little too lime and not enough salt). I was most surprised that the oysters were sweet and not strongly briny, mussels and snow crab were good. The meat station was solid - the veal steamship was juicy and fall apart tender, the lamb chops were perfectly cooked and good quality and the skirt steak was really tender which I'm normally not a fan of as it can be stringy. The baked salmon was surprisingly not overcooked and was perfect, The handmade dim sum were rather nice as I went back for seconds on their pork and leek dumpling. \n\nDessert wise they were also strong. I really enjoyed the panna cotta with berry, the creme brulee was great texture (though the top could have been torched more), their warm pizookie type cookie was awesome with a scoop of ice cream and fresh whipped cream. They had french macarons, which is my favorite, and theirs was surprisingly decent! I loved the orange with chocolate creme macaron out of the 5 flavors they had and overdid it with inhaling these. \n\nService was great. He was on top of drinks, but was also friendly and engaging conversation. \n\nMy bestie really enjoyed the variety and definitely thought it was worth it and gives it a 4 while she giggles about my funny hobby. Her BF is a bit of a picky eater and doesn't eat some of the higher ticket items like the seafood bar to have made it worth the high pricetag of what he got, though he thought it was good. \n\nI can see why this buffet gets rave reviews. It is quantity that is serving up some quality too. I don't know if it's \"good value\" enough for me to return on my own, but I'm sure I'll be back at some point with tourist friends.","review_id":"3BD1jAtoblBezVpv9e2T_g","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":6,"useful":15,"user_id":"n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew","date":"2013-05-07"},{"cool":1,"text":"Absolutely superb.\n\n7 Restaurants for the price of one really.

Similarly there will be a line a mile long to eat at the buffet, but the line moves and it is so well worth the wait. \n\nThere's something for everyone, from fish and shellfish to steaks and meat loaf. From sushi to pasta to tacos. The food's delicious and you'll want to keep going back for more. My favorites included the rigatoni with sausage, some of the Asian dishes, and the carne asada tacos. \n\nBut for me, the highlight, the cherry on top, is the dessert station.

They have cold and HOT crab legs. If you want them hot go to the Italian station at the other end of the buffet where you see some cooks making pizza. Ask the guy next to the big pots.\n\n- The line for the taco bar is very long so it's best to get a couple or don't plan on coming back.\n\n- Make sure you don't get an end piece of prime rib. They are overcooked and dry. Ask for a middle piece that's pink.\n\n- Avoid the pad thai, mac and cheese, macaroons, tofu cake pops, and churros.\n\nOverall there are a lot of options and I find myself choosing this place over Wicked Spoon.

This new and remodeled buffet looks extravagant! The quality of food here definitely exceeded my expectations for a buffet. I mean think about it...they put $17 million dollars into this franchise for a buffet, so of course this has to be at top notch with Wynn (I think it's better...Ek...I think I have to update my Yelp profile for favorite places to eat)!\n\nWhere to begin! Of course Caesar's Palace is like a maze, but I found the buffet quickly. You will notice that there are glass cups on the top of the column lights. The line pouring out from left to right...God knows when you will be next, but guess what? The line wasn't too bad (about twenty to thirty minutes). Then, you wait to be seated and notice the clear plates, bowls, cups, pitchers...etc hanging from the ceiling in their own little box. As well as tanks of fresh display of fish and crustaceans.\n\nOnce seated in the Seven Diamond and Platinum area (front of the buffet), you are basically next to the delicious seafood station as well as the dessert station. Let's begin with the stations from left to right.\n\nSeafood Station #1: Where all your money is going toward! Huge selection of fresh stone crab as well as king crabs (guess what you have an option of serving it cold or hot, some were salty and some were sweet), oysters (kind of tiny), mussels, cocktail shrimp (black prawn therefore enormous!), clams and where was the lobster? Located in a lobster bisque (very salty)...wish that they served it whole or at least the lobster tail. There was ceviche that had way too much lime...Whoa! Don't try this. The oyster shooter was very good! Much more selections (Just wanted to tease your taste senses)! Nom nom!\n \nAmerican Station #2: The top notch American favorite! Prime rib (melted in your mouth), lamb chops, hen (ask to cut which part you want or get the whole hen), BBQ ribs, veal, brisket, sausages, burger sliders (overcooked), sweet potato fries, criss cut fries, tator tots (not too greasy), macaroni and cheese (disappointed because some of the macaroni was uncooked), baked beans, chicken tenders, mashed potatoes (kind of looked unappetizing and the gravy was in a plastic bottle...hope it was BPA certified but it was good still), etc. Also, at the end, you get to choose condiments from these cute mini size jars! Love that all American feast!\n\nMexican Station #3: People people?! Omg! Unlimited ribeye steaks! That's right! Ask the personal chef to cook it how you like it! Yum! Of course I can't forget my nachos (this one is for you Frank S.) The chips were nicely seasoned as well as crispy. The different selection of toppings was excellent! There were over twenty selections...(Drool)! Homemade corn and flour tortillas, Spanish rice, tamales, refried beans, and so on. Bring out the Mariachi, time to celebrate!\n\nItalian Station #4: My favortie selection of foods of all time...but was disappointed. The selection here was simple. Baked ziti pasta (macaroni was not cooked all the way and BE CAREFUL the clayware is EXTREMELY HOT....burned myself...) TALK ABOUT SAFETY ISSUE..., baked lasagna, spaghetti and meatballs (a bit dry and not well seasoned), pizza, Alfredo pasta, pesto pasta, and deli sliced meats right in front of you...I think that is it. Not worth eating at this station...\n\nSalad Bar Station #5: Fresh and crisp! You can't even describe the beautiful colors as well as the selection...your stomach just grumbles...FEED ME! I have to say I recommend the feta cheese and watermelon! There was a wide selection of assortative cheeses...Mmm...Pepper jack. The vegetables are crispy and not like the limpy kinds that you get at a regular buffet. Yes! There is a huge selection of salad dressings as well! Cheers to you vegans! \n\nJapanese Station #6: Fresh sushi and sashimi! Seaweed salad, fatty yellowtail, poke stack, California roll, salmon roll, spicy tuna roll, unagi roll, and the list goes on and on! Can't go wrong with this station! \n\nCONTINUED BELOW (GUESS YELP HAD A CONTEXT LIMIT)...Sorry fellow Yelpers couldn't post this one on the same day.","review_id":"x9RmEGzW3bi0xfWkDyPwvw","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":3,"useful":12,"user_id":"VDnD3RKPGjIA66cAULW9iQ","date":"2012-11-01"},{"cool":1,"text":"My brother insisted that I try this buffet and so I did.

So I have her to thank for that and we got in line to go in right after. \n\nWe still had to wait in line for about 20 minutes - there was this other line that they opened up next to us and they kept letting the people from that line in immediately - I was thinking they were either guest of the hotel or some kind of VIP because they got this black placard with a diamond on it - looks important. The hostess was reassuring me that I would get our table soon - and after 15 people went in from the other line and 20 minutes later we finally got our table right in front of the steamed crab legs - perfect for my parents because that's pretty much what they eat.\n\nThis buffet was truly amazing in it's selection of foods. There biggest section was Seafood, Asian and Desserts- they had so much seafood choices, I wish I had a big enough stomach to try everything. \n\nThe meats that I've tried - lamb chop was tender and juicy but the beef ribs were a tad chewy and the pork ribs were really dry. All the seafood that I tried (oysters, crab legs, cocktail shrimp and mussel) were fresh and appropriately prepared. I also had a beef slider - tasty! a few of the sushi rolls and salad. \n\nOverall the food was very fresh and you see them refill it with a fresh batch of food as it runs low. Lots of there food actually do run low so it's a good sign - some buffets have food that sits there for a while but I didn't see that happening here. I didn't eat a whole lot of desserts since I was already really full with the savories - but I did have room for a macaroon, mango pudding and creme brulee. Yummy Yummy definitely filled my tummy that night.  This buffet is fairly new so we'll have to wait a couple of years to see if it will go downhill - but at $50 a person I really hope not.

We were all in vegas this past weekend and wanted to eat here to celebrate my sister's birthday. I was running late to meet up with my parents and sister and husband. So they waited in line first. They told me that you had to grab a ticket to reserve a time to come back since there was a long wait or you could pay $20 plus the dinner price (around $53) just to not wait the 2 hours and wait in line. So they were waiting in line around 6:15PM on a Saturday. My wife, her parents and I finally met up with my family in front of the buffet. I saw that they had a separate line for the total rewards members; a seven stars, diamond and platinum line and a regular line to wait. This was the first time I got to use my diamond players card to my advantage. There wasn't anyone in the diamond line so I walked right up. The worker called me and we basically just had to pay and walked right into the buffet. No waiting at all! This was the best use of my diamond card and started off the Bacchanal Buffet experience on a good note!\n\nWe were seated right at the front. I believe they seat the higher card holder members in their own area. So there was 8 of us and they gave us a nice 8 person table with a great location next to the seafood kitchen at the front of the buffet. The worker told us all the different kitchens and locations. The buffet is huge! You walk to the back of the buffet and turn the corner and they have 2 other kitchen areas to eat at. \n\nThe asian kitchen had some really good food. They had duck and dim sum and ramen/udon/pho. They also had sushi there and steamed crabs that were really fresh. I got the steamed crabs and the worker was really nice. The steamed crabs are brought out in pots so if they run out they have to make more and you just have to wait or come back for the next batch. They have an american and italian section. The wagyu beef sliders were so good! A definite must try! The meat kitchen had so much good food. They had lamb chops, ribs, prime rib, and other goodness. They had little bottles of juice. The horchata was delicious! The seafood kitchen had oysters, cold crab legs and shrimp and some fish. There was so much food to choose from. I would definitely come back to try out more food as there was way too much good food to choose from. The dessert area had really good desserts as well. They had shave ice with different flavors and topping to put on it. The popping pearls were surprisingly delicious!\n\nThe buffet is decorated really nicely. They have lots of glass decorations everywhere and like a glass wall in the front. The buffet is really open and feels really big. The food selection is great and gives you a lot of choices to cater to different tastes. This is probably my #1 buffet now in vegas. The buffet is pretty pricey though with dinner around $53 a person. But this experience was definitely worth it and the food was excellent!\n\nIf you eat here with someone who is a platinum, diamond or seven stars member, make sure to use the benefits and cut the line!","review_id":"BYiuBe_P0y9Me8c0cRzXeg","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"wEnNhKTWaIh_zlngQ7S-TQ","date":"2014-07-14"},{"cool":8,"text":"Am I the only one who thought Bacchanal was pronounced \"back-anal\"?

Despite the questionable meaning of the name, we decided to have a late lunch here after eating at Wicked Spoon the night before, to compare the two highest-rated buffets in Vegas. As of now, Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon are on the same tier of best buffets in Sin City and I honestly can't decide which is better.\n\nThe wait was over an hour long. Bacchanal's decor and ambience is definitely more contemporary and modern than other Vegas buffets, and I believe overall caters more to \"foodies\" -- especially in terms of food presentation, which was bordering molecular gastronomy. The buffet spread was impressive and the broad selection consisted mostly of tapas, including pho, ramen, various cuisines, and plenty of desserts to choose from. As I'm not a fan of buffets (I prefer quality over quantity), I don't quite exactly remember what I ate -- just that I didn't hate anything and there were enough tasty things to eat to get full and feel fully satisfied. I do recall that although the desserts were very aesthetically pleasing, most tasted surprisingly underwhelming.\n\nDespite me not remembering any of the food I ate, mostly due to me not taking any photos, I'd still come back a second time to give it another try before passing final judgement.","review_id":"qm4Xjr9D1y0BZPBVJkOrJA","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":16,"useful":7,"user_id":"3KK7L2Q6NMfJA1Ky4Ntmdg","date":"2014-02-24"},{"cool":5,"text":"Sat AM brunch/lunch.  very impressive.  500 items so it's a challenge to try everything,  but I recommend the fresh-squeeze juices in a bottle -- don't get OJ from the staff.  the fried chicken was impressive, crispy outside and juicy inside, can't usually get it like this.  also I was rather surprised by the pho and ramen, and other tiny stations that will make things for you.  while not all items are the best necessary, it's excellent for a buffet.  crepes freshly made, interesting sorbet flavors.  the tiny breakfast bite sizes are great, small little fryer baskets, plus ingenious little handles on the dishes to make them easy to pick up.","review_id":"DGn2YErm_IMKB83euxRbvw","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":2,"useful":6,"user_id":"kS1MQHYwIfD0462PE61IBw","date":"2012-10-21"},{"cool":0,"text":"Bacchanal Buffet is located inside Caesar's Palace.

But, the bacon balsamic sorbet was a definite repeat.\n\nThe best dish I have eaten at ANY buffet was the truffled scalloped potatoes.  I would gladly pay $25 for this dish at a steakhouse.  It was very thinly sliced potatoes and an excellent sauce, combined with excellent truffle flavor.  Had a nice crunchy top.  And, you get your own small portion, something a few buffets here are doing now.  It's a good trend.\n\nThe line went very quickly too, and that's an issue with a lot of places in town.  It was well organized and the employees were smart and courteous.

The reason that I say \"almost as good\" is because the eggs benedict that I got was cold :(. However, I give them five stars for their  crab legs! I didn't know that you could ask them to steam them - so much better than ice cold, in my opinion. And they were delicious!! I like my crab legs with just lemon, none of that butter stuff - but if you want it, it's there. The prime rib was on point and the dim sum was good as well. I also really enjoyed their made to order crepes at the dessert station. I get mine with just nutella but they have all of the fruit toppings also.

When we were walking to our table, I saw many tables that had not been cleared of plates, but were just waiting to be filled. \n\nUnlimited drinks ( fruit juices ( they have fresh squeezed watermelon juice, carrot juice, etc, but unfortunately, when we tried to order them they ran out :( , coffee, soft drinks, tea w/ real honey !!! imported from France !!!! , ) \nThe coffee was hot, but I wish they used a darker roast, because there wasn't that much flavor.\n\nalcoholic drinks are extra. \n\nSeafood = oysters ( I had about 35 of these, I wish they were bigger, they were soo small compared to the picture shown in the advertisements)  The oysters flesh was kinda washed apart, like they had been washed too much.  So the flesh of the oysters became flaky. \n            crab legs =   I had a small piece of crab from my friends place, it was a little salty but not that bad, I like how you can choose to steam the legs.  I don't eat crab / try not to, because they are becoming endangered. \n            Mussels & clam & paella = all yummy esp the little bits of ham in the mussel soup \n            Cocktail shrimp = the shrimp were bigger than most shrimp cocktail i've eaten, not as big as tiger shrimp though . \n             \nMeat = prime rib juicy and tender \n             lamb chop = could have been more tender, and they had a whole bucket of them sitting on the serving station, so I'm not sure how long they were cooked before they were served. \n             slider = soo tender and i loved the mayonnaise spread the had on the buns \n\nMexican = fresh tortillas & guac & the mexican style sweet corn w/ butter & cheese & chili  the mexican pollo soup ( i'm not sure what it was called ) it was red and oily on top was very yummy and savory. \n\nJapanese  = They had tuna poke salad !!!  & the fish was very fresh ! \n               sadly no sashimi, but the sushi was all very fresh. \n                also have your choice of miso soup ( make your own ) \n\nChinese = typical chinese food, they had xiao long bao and lo mai gei !!! \n               xiao long bao is the soup dumpling, and lo mai gei is the glutinous rice with meat inside.   sweet & sour soup was good too !\n\nItalian =  they had 6 different kinds of dried meats to choose from \n                (Prosciutto, Pancetta, Dried Beef, Salami, and a few other kinds ) \n                these were all delicious, and tasted very good with the cheeses & fresh fruit they offered. \n\nFruit  / Salad = I didn't have any salad because I didn't want to waste space in my stomach, but the honey dew was so sweet !!! Too bad they ran out after everyone else figured out how delicious it was.  The watermelon wasn't that sweet. \n\nCheese = I tried the white cheddar, and blue cheese, and my friend said the parmesan was yummy even though she doesn't usually like cheese.  I tried the blue cheese on accident, and spat it out because I hate blue cheese. But if you liked blue cheese, you would like there blue cheese. \n\nDessert = I don't save dessert for last, I feel like if you do that then you will run out of room in your stomach.  I prefer to intersperse my dessert within my meals at buffet, that way you can try everything. \n             Creme bruleee = they have chocolate & regular creme brulee here, I tried the chocolate one and it was pretty good. \n          TIramisu = so good and light !!!! unhh i really liked it. \n          Chocolate dipped strawberry =good \n           Chocolate & cheesecake pop = so decadent and rich and creamy. the white chocolate cheesecake pop was SO GOOD. I would buy these separately if they offered them. \n           Flan = i finished all of it so good. \n           White / pink fluffy marshmallow = mmm so light ! home made too i think ! I even felt cute eating it ! \n           Mini red velvet cupcake = so cute loved the decoration ! and cheesecake frosting was delicious. \n          Syringe dessert = i enjoyed injecting my dessert with red jam like filling, too bad they are probably not reusable. \n\n\nGelato = only tried the sorbet, blood orange, tangerine, and watermelon mint all sooo refreshing light and fruity. \n\nCrepes = so good !!!! ate a whole bunch of the fresh fruits that they offered as well !!! \n\n\nWe ended up staying at the buffet for 2 hours, I wish I stayed for longer, and walked some laps around the buffet so I could have eaten more. \n\nP.S.Cannot believe I wrote so much, I commend anyone whom actually read all of this shit.","review_id":"3_mYRdUQfsG34FjQwVNPiQ","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":13,"useful":18,"user_id":"AE8nHSRPFlB4nh7CP8PlGQ","date":"2012-10-16"},{"cool":0,"text":"We came here on a Saturday night.

We rolled up, put our name down and printed out a ticket that said when we should come back and that we'd receive a text to confirm that as well. With the terrible reception in the casino/shopping area, we received that text a lot later than expected. We were in line forever...waiting and waiting...that we missed the cutoff time for lunch.

And all the food items do definitely taste better than at other buffets.\n\nCurrent promotion: Sign-up for the Caesar's credit card and get automatic platinum status (which means a much shorter buffet line) and 2-for-1 buffet passes (which for Bacchanal means a discount rate - weekend dinner was $40 for 2 people).\n\nOn a Friday night at approx. 7:00pm, the line was fairly short.\n\nThere is a drink menu you can order off of at your table. There's cocktails, wine, and beer. You can also opt to pay $22 for unlimited drinks, and you get to keep the glass. Mimosas, merlot, chardonnay, Miller Lite, or Newcastle were the unlimited drink options. And no switching back and forth. So if you choose merlot, you're drinking merlot all night. The servers do a really good job of keeping the unlimited drink glasses filled.\n\nThe buffet itself is actually not as large as some other spots (though certainly larger than some others). There's a wide variety of food offerings. And again, everything was definitely tastier than at other buffets I've been to. I also really liked the small plates concept. I was a little disappointed, though, as several of the items in the Yelp reviews and pictures were not actually anywhere to be found.\n\nThe biggest disappoint of all was the lack of Alaskan king crab. I was told there was king crab! But both the cold and steamed offerings were just snow crab. This put a serious damper on my experience as I'd been so looking forward to devouring a whole bunch of king crab.\n\nThe seafood options are pretty good, though. A nice selection of both warm and cold. I particularly liked the clams. I wish they'd had a red vinaigrette for the oysters, though.\n\nThey also have prime rib, which was something I had multiple servings of. It wasn't particularly flavorful, but with the au jus and horseradish, it was good.\n\nThe Wagyu beef sliders were also delicious.\n\nThere are a lot of dessert offerings. I think I literally tried every flavor of gelato. Not the best gelato I've had, but I definitely liked that they had a variety of unique options.\n\nAll in all, it was a good experience.

Lobster Corn Chowder and Shrimp and Grits were okay.\n\nAMERICAN/CARVING STATIONS-good comfort foods...perfect mini sliders, mini baskets of fried goodness-wings, fish and chips,chicken tenders, fried chicken, potato skins, onion rings, etc. Carving station had a similar set-up as well, your usual sides and meats...Prime Rib, Sausage, Turkey, Ribs, Brisket, Steamship Round, etc. Tomahawk Steaks and Lamb Chops were a cool addition. Lamb was one of my faves, Tomahawk slices were unfortunately full of fat and gristle.\n\n\nMEXICAN/ITALIAN STATIONS-again, your familiar selections(Pizza, Pasta, Tacos, Pozole, etc.not really anything to set them apart from the rest, I snapped photos, but decided not to fill up on items from these stations.\n\nINFUSED HONEY/CHEESE/CHARCUTERIE/ARTISINAL BREADS-Already a winning combo of tasty cheeses,charcuterie, and breads, do not pass up the infused honey which ties everything else in very nicely.\n\nSALADS/ASIAN STATION-The Watermelon and Feta Salad was good, and the Tonkotsu Ramen was pretty good for being at a buffet . I was curious about the Ginseng Chicken, which was slightly bitter and medicinal...first and last time trying this one! Passed up the rest of the store looking sushi, stir-frys, and salads...again, familiar stuff like all the other buffets, nothing to set themselves apart, no wow factor, nada....\n\nDESSERTS-Lots of eye candy with the spread here...Favorites were the Baklava Ice Cream, and the simplicity of a warm crepe made to order. Sorbets were more like an icy granita and lacked the smooth texture a sorbet should have, the Blackberry Panna Cotta glass was way more gelatinous than Jello. Of course, your standard cakes, pies, tarts, cupcakes, etc....99% of buffet goers would easily snatch up French Macarons, and I'm part of that 1% that could easily decline with no regrets.\n\nOverall, 3.5 Stars.... Cool, sleek, modern spacious look that seems to have taken up the majority of the 17 million dollar investment, I was expecting the food to be on a more elevated level, outshining the competition on the strip, but that wasn't the case here. I honestly have had better first impressions at Studio B, Wynn, and Wicked Spoon, when those buffets first opened. 500 globally inspired dishes doesn't mean better....Sometimes less is more.\n\nWill The Bacchanal Buffet be able to hold on to the top spot?

Coincidentally, this was THE buffet that popped into my head when they said they only had time for one buffet. For a few of them, it was their first time in Vegas...and when you're in Vegas you gotta go with the best, the #1 buffet in Vegas, right?!\n\nWith a group of 9 and being islanders...yes, that can make things complicated. Some of us are always on that \"Hawai'ian time\" haha. Fortunately, we were all seated immediately when our whole party arrived. \n\nThe most memorable options from Bacchanal: \n\n- My fave was the Thai Curry mussels. I LOVE Thai curry and I LOVE mussels. I went back for more. \n- Along with that, the most memorable were the Pork Belly with yams (surprisingly, it worked well together) \n- pork street tacos - freshly grilled, there's usually a line but worth the wait. \n- chocolate cake pop, steamed crab legs, flavorful clams. \n- ohhhhhh and the cheese station. I LOVE CHEESE. I enjoyed their selection. I went back for more. I love cheese. \n\nThe juice station was a nice touch. I loved it! I haven't seen that in any other buffet. Sorry, no photo. I tried the tamarind and horchata. They were delicious. I love the fact that it's displayed in bottles, so after you pile your plate you can stop here on your way back and pick up a bottle without worrying about spilling. \n\nBeing a buffet pro, I strategically saved dessert for last. I didn't want to get too full too fast. \n\nTip: No carbs, save dessert for last, don't drink too much liquids, eat your seafood (crab legs ;-) ) first. Check out your options first before you start piling your plate. \n\nOur beverage server was ON POINT. He had the best customer service skills that I've seen in any buffet or food service establishment. I'm sorry, I don't remember his name. He checked up on us every few minutes, he was kind, enthusiastic, full of energy. His work ethic was a 20 on scale of 1 to 10. \n\n The dessert station is the best I've seen so far in all Vegas buffets. They have a made to order crepe station!!! I was too full to try the crepes but my cousins got to try it and they enjoyed it. The most popular items that night were the cake pops and macaroons. Those were awesome. Those were restocked every 30 mins. Luckily on my last trip back to the dessert station the macaroon tray was filled. Yes! I finally get to try it. \n\nI've went to many buffets here and this is the one I'd recommend!

Without a doubt the preeminent buffet we've taken in while devouring Vegas; but I'd have to say that we'll be trying others before a return.

Randomly located at the Italian food station. Look for 4 big pots and you gotta ask the chef to get them for you.\n-Charcuterie. Not an expert but it all tasted fine to me.\n-Sliders. Better than White Castle at least.\n-Pizza.

Only tried maybe 1/3rd because I got too full but most were good.\n-Electronic kiosk that will text you when it's time to line up.\n-Overall restaurant decor.\n-Food presentation and sheer variety.\n-Service. Frequent water refills and nearly every time I got up to get more food by the time I got back the old plates were cleared out.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Cold crab legs. Way too salty.\n-Lamb chops. Overcooked.\n-Macarons. Many different colors, all taste the same.\n-Ethnic food section.

The buffet is pricy, to really make up for the price and the hour wait to get in ...  you better be really hungry :).","review_id":"ocoeonvfXAiMlv3kwsKcQQ","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"AvlcCUhYaOldKwa4DAKy6Q","date":"2013-07-23"},{"cool":0,"text":"Came here on Easter weekend cause a friend and her family was in town. Totally forgot that buffets jack up the price on holiday weekends. Spent a total of $148 for my bf and I ($74/person)\n\nWas it worth it? Nope!\n\nFood - Some were good and some were not. Their Asian food was not bad. Sui Mai dishes tasted better than other restaurants I've been too. Their Brie and truffle oil pizza was good but obviously not as great at Sammy's Woodfired Pizza. It would probably taste the same if the crust was thin like theirs. Their seafood section wasn't interesting to me at all. Everything is on ice, miso halibut was super sweet and the lobster chowder was beyond salty. Sushi section, the nigiri weren't bad at all. Desserts are awesome. I love me some rich chocolate!\n\nDrinks - by the bread station they have a bunch of mini milk bottle type w a variety of juices. Love love love the guava!\n\nAll in all, it was good but nothing to boast about. Would I come back? Definitely not.

They did have strange pouchy things with meat in them that were ok.  Maybe I was there at a bad time, but the food tasted old.  My fiance liked it, but she is Asian.  Getting an Asian to like Asian food is like getting a dollar bill into a stripper's g-string (it isn't that hard).\n2) Carving Station: Brisket was very very fatty and tough.  It seemed very rushed as though they didn't have time to cook it properly or to trim the fat.  The pulled pork sliders were very good though and actually the highlight of the entire buffet.  But, the brisket was a disappointment.  I walked up to the station and said \"I want some brisket\" and the guy gave me a rectangle of lard and fat.  I then said \"no...not lard...brisket.\"  Yeah...it was that bad.\n3) Pizza Station: The pizza was actually decent.  It was cooked in an actual pizza oven, and honestly I ate the pizza more than anything.  My fiance thumbed her nose at me thinking I was a peasant eating something so juvenile like pizza.  I needed to remind her that she did not have air conditioning until about 5 years ago....so I think our degree of class is about even at this point.\n4) Seafood Station: I heard there were crabs here and I was looking all over for them at this station.  No crabs....it seems the crabs were served later.  Instead they had crawfish, which were horrific (I am cajun) and some oysters (which I am not crazy enough to try).  You want to try raw oysters at a buffet then be my guest, but I will not pay for your investment in 2-ply toilet paper.  \nThen....suddenly....the crab legs are served!!!  People jumped on them like they had \"hot and cold runnin blondes\" in them.  I do not know what that saying means, but I hear rednecks say it when something seems good.  Anyway, I grabbed some crab legs.  They were cold.....like iced down cold.  Weird, but I like cold seafood...and they were already cracked open for you.  Pretty cool.  Holy crap these things were full of salt.  Tons of salt.  That is all you could taste from these crab legs was salt.  Certainly this was a mistake right?  They couldn't be this salty on purpose could they?\n\nBig disappointment, but probably one of the better buffets on the strip....which is a sad state of affairs.  Go here if you want to experience a buffet and are starving....that is the only way you will make your money back.  Apparently I lost some class street cred.....thanks Bacchanal.","review_id":"PY5_Da0JC6FrlBxNYYp1qA","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":0,"user_id":"1IMyRISO6_VgWA2GamCw5w","date":"2014-06-27"},{"cool":1,"text":"I've been here so many times before for brunch and I never fully enjoyed it to it's extent but that all changed when when I went for dinner this past Monday night!\nMaybe it's because I've always been drunk or super hungover so I cant ever really stomach buffet food but I was sober this time and it was soooo gooooooood!!\n\nMy boyfriends a Diamond status for Total Rewards so we got to skip the entire line & got seated right away which was definitely a PLUS because the line here is always SUPER long.. like 2+ hours wait long.\n\nIn my opinion, buffets are ALWAYS better for dinner than brunch.  I don't want no scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage when I'm at a buffet... I want the GOOD STUFF. and thats exactly what I got when I went ;)\n\n$108 for 2 people for dinner.\n$80-$90 for 2 people for brunch on a weekend? that includes unlimited mimosas.\nIf you're a Total Rewards member, use those points for a free meal!

The quality of seafood is always a hit or a miss at buffets in my opinion, but the quality here was well worth the money.  \nOysters were very fresh with no fishy smell/taste, the crab legs had decent amount of meat to them & the nigiri was fresh as well.  \n\nI also finally got to try the juices that come in cute little bottles.   I tried the Guava, Mango & Horchata. Mango was really good and I also liked the Horchata but I found it a bit too sweet for my taste.\n\nNothing much to complain about here except I would stay away from the hot & sour soup and the prime rib as I found both of them to be extremely salty and unsatisfying.\n\nNOW FOR THE DESSERTS!\nLoved:\n+Chocolate covered strawberries--the chocolate one was sweet & salty.  \n+CREME BRULEE--such perfection.\n+Italian Cookie Gelato is probably the best flavor they offer.\n+Macarons are soft and sweet.

My friends however, heard about the amazing new Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace - recently renovated and bomb food. Why have I not heard about this such buffet? The Yelper in me was disappointed in meself.\n\nMy girls and I stopped by on a Saturday around 1:30pm, waited on the line and got in just after 2pm. Total damage per person came out to ~$54. What the what? $50 pp for a lunch?! Luckily, my money savvy friend asked the cashier and found out that $50 included bottomless mimosas. Ohhhh. Yessss.\n\nThe interior of the buffet is refreshing and neat. There are three separate sections that have three distinct decoration themes. Our party of 10 was given a choice to sit near the food or a bit further away in our own little private seating area. Private seating area it is - VIP baby! Our seating area was perrrrrrrf, save for the clear tiles separating us and the hallway next to the buffet where a ton of drooling patrons, wandering babies, and people judging us, walked by the entire 3 hours we were there (it's a 2 hr max btw, but they aren't super stingy).\n\nOur waitress came out the moment we sat down and got our orders for 10 mimosa, OJ, apple juice, and waters out ASAP. She was super sweet and patient, always clearing our dishes without fail and juggling our needy orders - 18% gratuity well deserved. The only thing she did incorrectly was take away a friend's plate before she was finished - including her utensils! I'd liken that to a blessing in disguise since my friend was able to fit some other things in her tummy ;)\n\nNow let's get dizzown to bizznazz - how was the food? How about... everything we ate was spectacular? Surriously, not a single thing offered a \"meh\" out of anyone's mouth. \n\n- The buffet starts off with an amazing seafood spread of cold or hot crab legs, mussels, and oysters (we sat down at 2pm, dinner started at 3pm, so we got the best of both worlds for a lower price!). \n\n- Next came the little metal carts of fried food! Potato cakes garnered approval from much of the group. I especially LOVED the fried chicken, HOW DO THEY KEEP IT SO DANG JUICY?! Mmmm. \n\n- Then you will come upon the glorious meat station!!!!!! There was a line for this station the entire time we were there, but it moves semi-quickly. Woulda moved quicker if the people at the station weren't so busy hamming it up with the meat man! Alas, I'm guilty of this myself...but the dude hooked it UP with the fattiest piece of delicious smoky brisket and rarest part of the prime rib there was. Don't be hatin' ;) Pick up a wagyu slider on your way back and let that all dat meat melt in yo' mouth (that's what she said!)\n\n- Following the meat station is the Mexican, Italian, Charcuterie, Japanese, and Chinese stations. Highlights from the above include the pulled pork from the Mexican station, tuna poke from the Japanese station, and the meatballs from the Italian station. Om freaking nom.\n\n- Dessert station was so abundant with selections I didn't even know where to begin. I picked up a banana and a pistachio soufflé STRAIGHT out of the oven, chocolate covered strawberries, and some toffee ice cream to wash that ish down.\n\nTo be honest, the food was so dang good that I didn't even TOUCH my mimosa for fear of getting too full from the bubbles. This is coming from an alcoholic. Legit! \n\nThe food was so dang good that my friend would not stop stuffing herself, despite being in so much pain, and ended up peeing, pooing, and puking herself in the bathroom. \n\nThe food was so dang good that my feet fell asleep while sitting on the toilet later. TMI? ;)\n\nI don't even want to TRY Wicked Spoon now that Bacchanal has stolen my heart.

So we brought a couple of friends to enjoy the night with us.  The line wasn't long for us to wait, but part of that was because our guests came early to do the waiting.  We get to the front of the line and provided the tickets.  We were mistaken for employees, but we soon rectified that.  Damn, our morals.  Anyhow, we were taken to our seats and the feasting began.\n\nI sat at the table to watch some purses and order some drinks.  When they got back, I got up as it was my turn to \"GLUTTON IT UP\"\n\nI started out with my new found favorite... Sushi.  I don't know exactly what I got but it was good.  Also on my plate was Dim Sum, Miso Soup, Lo Mein, and a couple of egg rolls.\n\nPlate 2, I decided to go a different route.  I had a Lamb Chop.  That was the first time that I have ever eaten lamb.  It was good and I didn't feel guilty because the lamb was probably a cute thing running around a couple of weeks prior.  On that plate was also, a slice of pizza, some more dim sum and some other things that I can't remember.\n\nPlate 3, the reason that I couldn't wait to get back.  Dessert: Cake Pops and Jelly Belly's.  Nothing else mattered to me.  I knew that I could eat about $30 worth of Jelly Belly's.  One of my weaknesses.  They were so good.\n\nThe company was fun too.

Finally got to try this buffet in August '13 and Oct '13!\n\nMy goal is pretty much to eat at every buffet offered in vegas and so far I've tried almost all of them! In my comparison to The Buffet at Wynn, Wicked Spoon, Aria, Bellagio, M Studio Buffet, I would say Bacchanal didn't exceed my expectations :( The Wynn still ranks best for me.\n\nBoth times that I've tried Bacchanal was during the time between brunch and dinner so I got to try food from both menus. Surprisingly the food doesn't change much... Both months had the same food for both brunch & dinner. TIP: Make sure you come in between so probably around 2/2:30 so you can get both brunch and dinner but pay only brunch price! Plus the wait isn't as long and goes by fast. Both times I only waited about 30 mins and make sure you get your TR card so you can get a discount it comes out to be about $40 with UNLIMITED MIMOSAS ETC\n\nAnyway the foods that really stood out for me were the sweet potato tater tots in the little baskets they were soooo good! The meat section always had a long line, the standout meats were the lamb chops & ribs. They had all sorts of variety of sausages as well from chicken to turkey. The prime rib was good perfect medium rare. I found out the reason for the long line at the meat station is 'cause there's only one worker manning the station. In other buffets they sort of divide up the meat sections so there isn't always one long line of carnivores waiting in line starving.\n\nIn the back is the asian/pizza section. The asian section here is HUGE compared to other buffets. Surprisingly the asian food served here is REALLY good. I like the crispy spicy fish thing (forgot what it was called) and the eggplants. My friends had a bunch of the sushi and said it was good quality. They give you these cute plastic fish soysauce holders also. The dim sum section was good especially the shu mai. The DIY pho broth and tonkatsu broth flavor were on point as well. Same with the roast duck & BBQ PORK!!! So yeah if you have a super asian family, bring them to bacchanal\n\nThe pizza here is ok, the Wynn is still better. The dough just isn't crisp enough\n\nCRAB LEGS!! They boil them fresh for you so you get hot crab legs to dip in butter. What most ppl overlook is their delicious clam chowder here!! It's sooo good and creamy with their pretzel/sourdough bread. The breads look like its on display, but you actually can eat them I think that's why most ppl overlook the clam chowder area. They also have baked clams & mussels in little portioned buckets, but those were just ok\n\nThe Mexican food station is bomb as well, they've got made to order al pastor, chicken, etc tacos. I love the pulled pork as well it's always nice and tender\n\nOmelette - I like it here 'cause they use the nonstick spray to \"grease\" the pan instead of ladling a ton of oil onto the pan.\n\nDESSERTS - They've got MOCHI, gelato, and DIY crepes. The dessert section isn't as great as the wynn or wicked spoon. However, they have these delicious chocolate cookies w/ peanut butter filling inside sooooooo good!!\n\nOverall this buffet is HUGE! I pretty much ate everything there, but still something was missing at this buffet, not sure what.","review_id":"sbyoJnGa3ZX03jlmKHE2kQ","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":3,"useful":8,"user_id":"u6Rb0yrjDvYpAFOgXL8WXQ","date":"2013-10-29"},{"cool":1,"text":"Go for dinner!

I would have to say this place makes you feel like you are dining in a nice modern restaraunt.

But I must say over time... the QUALITY of the oyster went down... they used to shuck them fresh but now you could tell they are being schucked & held in the refrigerator until they place them out... =\\ SUPER DISAPPOINTING but also noticed this downgrade of quality started to occur when they brought out STONE CRABS. I would much prefer fresh oysters over COLD stone crabs especially when they already offer king crab legs cold & HOT which I LOVE HOT LEGS!! \n\nI also love the FRESH tacos they make to order w/ refreshing AGUA FRESCAS that they offer. They also have NOODLE SOUPS like pho & udon which is awesome to have refreshing hot broth to wash all the food down. \n\nDESSERTS are AWESOME here as I LOVE the flan & the chocolate covered strawberries plus the mochi ice creams & crepe! \n\nDINNER on a weekend is about $60 & if you wanna pass the line then you could pay $20 / person which is not worth it IMHO... the prices are cheaper during the weekday & if you time it right, you could pay lunch price & roll into dinner items =] \n\nOne other awesome thing is that they give you a little wet towelette that smells like citrus to wipe your hands after all the crab legs you eat.","review_id":"g4uWYKP6FmTm-yxhjN2YyQ","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":5,"useful":5,"user_id":"x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA","date":"2015-11-02"},{"cool":2,"text":"Abundant.

It was my second time eating here yesterday and it did not disappoint. I went with friends in town for dinner so the price on a Sunday was a hefty $55 but it did not disappoint. First time I was here was back in November on a Saturday early noon and the line was about a 20 minute wait. Yesterday, Sunday around 4:30pm there was no wait in line at all, but there was a rush of people whe we concluded our meal. \n\nOn my first trip to this buffet, I had one of the best cooked prime ribs I'd ever had. On my second trip here, I strayed away from that and instead focused more on the seafood.\n\nPresentation was unlike anything I've seen before. They had tiny little cute buckets of wings or fried chicken pieces with fries. The lasagna was served on a tiny skillet with a decent amount of meat and the sauce, was UNBELIEVABLE. The chef's special was also served on a tiny cute little iron pan and it was a lightly breaded calamari.\n\nOn my first trip, I thought the shrimps were bigger and the king crab legs were small portions and were also very salty. But I realized this was only because it was busier back in November when I went as there was a 5min wait to get the king crabs. This second time around, there was alot less of a wait and I just realized the workers there can serve you warmed up king crab that is dipped in hot water. I got my king crab served this way this time around and they were far less salty and on point and of course, dipped it in the melted butter!! \n\nIn the seafood section I also enjoyed the baked salmon, pan seared halibut, mussels, half shell oysters, corn lobster bisque, the large shrimp, and an amazing oyster shooter! \n\nInstead of prime rib, I thought I'd try the pork ribs and the lamb chops. The chops were amazing and very juicy! The pork ribs, on the other hand were not so much. \n\nI was hoping for standing chocolate ice cream but they had one that had cinnamon that I wasn't too big a fan of. \n\nOverall, this place is highly recommended by me if you have friends in town.","review_id":"2J4d-CzLxOpXjU2BHMv8Qg","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"RSLTG7N0wYJhRTW5CGEm5Q","date":"2013-01-14"},{"cool":1,"text":"Buffet of all buffets\n\nIve tried a lot of buffets in vegas, but no one ends up giving this experience.

Feel free to refer to my first review (http://www.yelp.com/biz/elite-grand-opening-feast-bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:HtoQJRMMYxheSWyYYU_3XA) for the \"before\" comparison.\n\nWith my mom in town, I knew I had to take her to the latest Vegas hot spot. It was her first experience here and my first chance to see if the honeymoon period had worn off. The strategy was too obvious: go for lunch and stick around until the dinner menu transition. It actually worked too well since the wait only took 45 minutes starting from 1 pm. The weekday lunch price, which might or might not have included a slight players card discount, was $26.99. They've definitely raised the cost since opening week.\n\nAfter a circumnavigation of the dessert island, we were seated at a somewhat awkward table next to one of the glass dividers. It actually felt like my chair was in the middle of an obvious walkway. It wasn't that distracting for me, but I did have people try to walk around me sometimes. Oh, and while I'm on the atmosphere, it was dark because the light above us had burned out, but I think that all the awesome light fixtures are above bigger tables anyway. And the music was... well, lounge-y and loud enough to be heard but not distracting.\n\nI actually ended up trying a lot of different foods than in my last trip, and there were some real treats this time. The fish in the fish and chips basket was so fluffy and yummy. The lobster corn bisque was so good that I could eat it all day (but I only had two). The ramen was good enough that I found myself slurping up the broth, which clearly violates the general buffet principle of not consuming too much liquid. The poke salad was respectable for a buffet. The beef brisket didn't taste so strange this time, especially after cutting off the outer layer. The jumbo shrimp cocktail was solid, and the king crab legs (dinner menu) were great and came pre-steamed (no wait). Although the steaming was far from thorough, I enjoyed cold and warm crab meat alike.\n\nOut of the desserts, the top-it-yourself crepe was so good that I'm not sure why I skipped it the first time. I can't recall any other buffets with so much fresh fruit (sliced strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, and possibly a chance to do something which those bananas if you want) at the crepe station. With the cream and choice of syrups, you can probably just eat crepes all dessert long. The chocolate creme brulee was pretty thick and lived up to its billing as chocolate, although the brulee left a bit to be desired. I also tried new ice cream flavors this time: the aztec chocolate was strangest with its cinnamon and spiciness, the fig and basalmic was pleasantly sweet (although I'm not sure where the balsamic went), and the brown butter caramel was just so rich and creamy (my favorite so far).\n\nNot everything worked though, and that's fine. That's why you read Yelp to see what to avoid, or else sample modestly so you can cut your losses. I thought that the prime rib had too much inedible stringiness, the ceviche and gazpacho were too strong in a bad way, the crab croquettes and the italian meatballs were just okay, and the blackberry panna cotta was not as good as last time. Also strangely lacking were some of the desserts that I remember from my first visit, including a green tea mousse - maybe it's only brought out later at night?\n\nI haven't been to all the other popular buffets too recently, but Bacchanal is still probably the best buffet in Vegas.

We came back 90 min later... only to find out that there were 2 more lines to wait in. Seriously?!?! Why even have the paper? Just call me when you are actually ready. We waited another 45 min or so to pay ( a ridic 65$ ish with a prepaid tip) and be seated. Why? They kept letting people ahead who paid to skip the line. That is ridiculous and infuriating. Anyway, when we finally got in, we were overwhelmed by the amount of food there. It was a ton. Unfortunately, pretty much none of it was good. There was one dumpling I got that was good, but upon returning, they didn't have anymore. Tried to ask of they had more and the man behind the counter claimed a different dumpling was it (not the case, clearly...one was shrimp one was pork). The pastas were all disappointing...flavorless..boring. The pho was ok, but the ramen was gross. The lamb chops were way underdone...super red...ew. Poor lambs. The seafood was overly fishy...not too fresh. The Mexican food was awful... my friend actually spit it out. The only good items were the mac and cheese, the cheese (duh), and the yellow curry. The desserts were a joke...flavorless again. The service was awful. We never got a refill on our drinks. Plates sat on our table ready to be cleared for a long time.

Caesars Palace really took it's time in renovation and making the decor and ambience a world class feel with contemporary looks and divisions of room sections. Place was clean in presentation as it should be with a newly open place.  Depending on the time of day...average wait times can range between 45 minutes to 1 hour and a half.  For now, being a newly open buffet with all the hype, expect off times to be at least a 45 minute wait.  During Lunch times 12:00pm and Dinner time around 6-7pm especially on a weekend,  you will most likely be there more than an hour.  The Lamb Chops and Rib Eye Steaks were excellently executed in cooking and portion size.  I would even go as to say the cuts of meat here rival and to some circumstances exceed quality of Texas de Brazil.  The New England clam chowder was creamy and filled to perfection with real clams. The dessert bar is exquisite, rather small looking in size it does have plenty of selection that one can appreciate to choose from.  The best part is the crepe station...and you can go around and add any toppings from fruits, to syrups, to nuts & chocolate, ice cream and even candy or more.  I could go on and on about the food...and pros...\n\n...but with the good reviews one may ask why I gave it a mediocre 3 stars???\n\n WELL ..... The quantity and variety deserve two thumbs up...but on an average appeal, Bacchanal would almost be typical to your usual quality buffet in Las Vegas.  The self advertised \"over 500 items\" supposedly makes it the most selections of food in a single buffet.  Could it be an illusion though, that it doesn't seem that way? Maybe...maybe not.  And what is up with the smaller portions in individual mini plates?  They must have took this one out of the book at (COSMOPOLITAN's \"Wicked Spoon\" BUFFET)  \"your welcome for the free plug and advertisement\" hehe, but on a serious note, this is plain ridiculous.  Sure it helps cut down on wasting food, but you can barely carry a plate with food without it taking up so much space! and plus more unnecessary dishes to clean?  I guess the price hike will take care of that.  On the other hand...the chefs/cooks cater to your needs upon availability.  Sometimes they are so welcoming, other times they are no where to be found or walking past you without acknowledgement.  It really is a hit or miss.  That is respectable for a busy buffet though.  What annoyed me is the price went up as I was told by the cashier for a second time.  Opening month was approx mid $35 minus any rewards club membership or discounts for dinner rates.  Now, the price with rewards card came out to $46 plus per person.  That's fine and dandy once in a while...but with that price you would expect the food on the counter being on point...re-filled and not being left to a crumb.  Not this time around I guess...it was kind of disappointing.  This was also my second time at this buffet...and our server looked lost giving us wrong drinks and not even making an effort to check on us or refill our drinks.  Felt like we were being ignored.  Could have been a second strike and bad day for our server...but no excuse for customer service.  We had to call a different server who apologized and gave us our drinks promptly.  Caesars management need to emphasize this critical area for it could be a downfall in the long run.  For this price...I might rather go to the Wynn, Bellagio or Wicked Spoon buffet instead.  Don't get me wrong...Bacchanal is a wonderful buffet experience that I recommend one tries at least once in their lifetime or during a Las Vegas Vacation trip...but seriously raising the price...Common Caesars Palace...Step it up!!! Next time I might not be so willing to empty my pockets and bring my hungry taste buds here...or more so... I may recommend others elsewhere, where they can get better quality and service.   I don't disagree with all the 4 & 5 star ratings on here...but this was a personal experience I had to be honest about during 2 visits here.  If I do come back a third time...please prove me wrong.","review_id":"25ru8Vqq99ONZpeuO4jCQA","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"Wp11jaXd3nQGwxTVH5ZTyg","date":"2012-10-21"},{"cool":0,"text":"No lines at 8:30am on a monday morning.

So, I highly recommend the practice of not eating during the day (easy if you sleep late), and arriving in line ON A WEEKDAY just before 3 p.m. That way, your wait in line will be practically non-existent, you will pay the lunch price (closer to $30), and they start trotting out the higher-end dinner items (I'm talking heated crab legs and lollipop rib eyes) almost immediately.\n\n  Now, imagine that you and a companion went for dinner in a regular restaurant, were served a basket of artisan breads with an assortment of cheeses and homemade jams, then you had a fried calamari appetizer, lobster corn chowder, Caesar salad, prime rib and crab leg combo  with broccoli au gratin and whipped potatoes, and creme' caramel for dessert. \n\nYour date had the oyster shooter, cream of mushroom soup, heirloom tomato caprese salad, sautéed halibut with haricots vert and scalloped truffled potatoes, and a nutella crepe with bananas and whipped cream. Assuming you didn't have to be wheeled out, would you squawk if you were presented a bill for a little over $60? I think not. Of course, you have to factor in the major inconvenience of walking 10 feet to get it yourself, but that horrific downside is somewhat modified by the fact that while you're up there anyway, you can help yourself to more Asian, Italian, Mexican, seafood, dessert, etc., options than even the fattest of fatties could ever hope to sample in a week, let alone a couple of hours (in other words, until you're full to the point of physical distress).\n\n And here's the thing: you may not like every single thing you choose, some things may not be prepared exactly to your liking. Don't eat it!!! It's a buffet! Trot yourself up and pick out 15 more things until you stumble across stuff that meets your standards. Make yourself happy! This place is great and deserves 5 stars just for the fact that they have some poor OCD guy back in the kitchen cutting up watermelon and feta cheese and assembling them into those little checkerboard squares.\n\n.And we have had nothing but good experiences with the servers, especially the meat cutter,  who act like they're actually glad you're there. I hate to say it, but it's possible that if you don't like this place, maybe you don't really like food?","review_id":"dego1QPdnew1ahOy9_wGDQ","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":5,"useful":2,"user_id":"-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A","date":"2013-07-19"},{"cool":0,"text":"The things that are a must-try in no order is the ramen, lobster corn chowder, prime rib, crepe, souffle, lamb chops, peppered beef, and their fried dishes that come in a basket.

Caught a good day with no line. Staff was helpful, friendly and prompt. Total rewards members (casino card program) entry is discounted. This buffet priced a little more than others but worth the difference. The discount helps it too.\n\nPan holders are provided and we are seated. Drink orders are taken in a timely fashion as we get straight to the stations. Lots of variety. Definitely one of the biggest around. There are clearly defined areas. Seafood, meat, Italian, Latin, Asian, dessert are some. There are dishes that are oven hot and have the pan holders if you left yours at the table. Fresh plates are used each round up. \n\nFor lunch there is not a limited selection of seafood. From salmon to halibut. Shrimp several ways. Ceviche, cocktail, et. Oysters, mussels, crab legs, crawfish are some offerings. Warm and cold are the variable plates. Properly maintained were the cold items such as the oysters. (I've gotten sick at other casino buffets)\n\nMeats. So many selections just at the carving station. Brisket, turkey ham, prime rib, mango chicken sausage, hot links, kielbasa were just a few I tried. The meats were seasoned masterfully. Meats melted and tender. The hot links were spicy mouth was burning. Oh so good though. Other items found at this station include fried chicken, roasted chicken, chicken and waffles, fries, potatoes, any practically anything for classic buffet faire. Most of the options were good. Some a little dry but nothing where enjoyment was lost.\n\nThe next station had some Latin faire. Chili Colorado, fajitas, enchiladas, rice, tamales and likes. These were some of the better Spanish and Latin I have tried at a buffet. Most times dishes are dry and lacking seasoning. These were moist, fresh, and wanting more.\n\nA salad bar, soups, rolls, and various small plates. Some good tried included the truffle soup, gratin potatoes, and truffle macaroni n cheese. Each of these were good enough to return for a second helping. Moist and seasoned to perfection both helpings. \n\nItalian and pasta station I didn't get much into. Classic fair of sauces, pizza et. They looked pretty good. \n\nAsian faire station has been by a mile the best for a buffet I have tried. Japanese, Korean, and Chinese faire. \n\nThere was a choice of three sushi rolls. Each distinctive. I enjoyed the spicy tuna roll. Fresh was the rice roll and the tuna. A good spicy was found. A ramen, pho, and udon station was available. I tried the ramen. Freshly made noodles are boiled to order in a light stock with the noodles, barbecue pork, and vegetables added (can be with held on request). The ingredients are pulled once cooked and added to a simple miso soup brith. The broth was seasoned and demonstrated respect found in preparation at a Japanese ramen house. \n\nFor Korean and Chinese dishes, I tried the golgibi beef, various dim sum (shu Mai, dumplings), and duck were some of the items enjoyed. Tender easy to eat beef was the golgibi. Dim sum items were flavored, sized and appropriate like found in many Chinese brunch times. Duck was fair amount of meat to fat. The Chinese and Korean offerings were better than most actual restaurant fair without the outrageous pricing. \n\nDessert and snack bar. Fruit, cookies, pies, pastries, donuts, gelato, chocolate/caramel apple and pears. My eyes at this point are bigger than my belly. Everything is so scrumptious. There is more than something for everybody here.\n\nGood: variety for everyone, flavors hit most marks, proteins were appropriate temperature and seasoned, organized, friendly. \nBad: didn't find lobster during lunch but otherwise everything was good and so full (from eating- not bad). \n\nI'd be back to eat more. Definitely one of the best buffets to date.","review_id":"79LBV4aWPbbTxPcM6ubAkA","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":3,"user_id":"fTWtXca0hmdjLQFvkrNDPw","date":"2015-01-08"},{"cool":1,"text":"Hands down the best buffet I've ever been to.

What's the corporate motto?  Go BIG or go HOME! And with this buffet, they went big. $17 million to build this place? I had to try it out.\n\nI went for Sunday lunch and the lines were pretty hideous.  I am glad that my friend is a diamond member and got us right up to the front, but I might have not had such great things to say about this place if I had waited for 2 hours.\n\nAmbiance: Urban Chic -- I can totally see this place turn into a swanky lounge at night.  Wooden decor along side the walls of what looks like a part of \"unblock\" pieces from my iPhone game, combined with the elements of delicate glass casing throughout the buffet.  Very well decorated, good lighting, and a decent set up of seating arrangements to fit different types of groups.\n\nFood: Variety.  Seafood, carvery, Asian, Mexican, Italian, deli, dessert... the staples of the Vegas buffet are all here.  However, biggest peeve of mine = cold crab legs.  Halfway through my meal, I realized that they will warm it up for you, but they do that by dunking the legs into hot water for a minute or two.  When it comes out of the vat of water, the crab has lost its bold flavor.  In addition, their sushi/ Japanese station was disappointing.  The freshness of the sushi was mediocre and the selections were few.  In terms of the food, they had many choices, including a wide selection of deli cuts and cheese and dessert station that included made to order crepes and notable gelato flavors, however, nothing stood out as \"amazing\" or worthy of the phrase \"YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS.\"\n\nService:  Perhaps they were understaffed, but there were moments during our meal where the empty plates were stacked and just sat at our table.  We would go for another round of food and return to find the plates still there.  Aside from that, our waiter was very kind and attentive to our needs when he did come by.  \n\nOverall, this is a good buffet and I see how they could have easily invested millions, however, it's not my favorite. I am sure I will be back, and it's worth a visit, but naming a buffet after a roman god definitely sets the bar at high expectations -- some tough shoes to fill.","review_id":"z6aEswtSdqBQrX-JpNJlcA","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":3,"user_id":"MspXtBLBkKJwEyfJ79YYJw","date":"2012-10-17"},{"cool":1,"text":"i'm a marathon eater and vegas buffets are my playground. my current favorite has to be bacchanal. \n\ni can't tell you every single thing ive eaten at this buffet, but here are a few notables:\n- chinese food/dimsum\n- tacos\n- kobe sliders\n- prime rib\n- baby lamb chops\n- oyster shooters\n- made to order ramen, pho, udon\n- mochi ice cream\n\npros:\n- delicious food! oh the delicious delicious food. the endless supply of delicious food\n- the new paging system! i was lucky to not have to use it, but apparently the paging system lets you go and gamble and drink without having to wait in line\n- the put a bar in! there used to be a fountain next to the line at the front, but the intelligently put a bar in for all the people who are waiting and don't gamble. at least let us drink the time away\n- wine list was pretty reasonable. while the wine itself was just okay, the prices were very doable. \n\ncons:\n- price. gone are the days when buffet was a nice $27. yea, dinner is pricey, but it's worth it. for the glutton in all of us. what happens in vegas stays in vegas, even if it's your weight in crab legs, right?\n\n*tip* if you want to try to avoid the lines, opt for going on sunday, there should be less of a line, and try to go on the early side \n\nwould i go again? yes!","review_id":"XKqAgqEKqMYeJxIXWOhC6w","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":2,"useful":3,"user_id":"JwF4WNVp2mY_HMeroVUOEw","date":"2014-03-11"},{"cool":0,"text":"I would have gone with 1 star, but I think my expectations were so high, that 1 might be a bit harsh.

There are so many dishes to choose from and just about everything is delicious (with a few exceptions; for example, I would avoid the sushi station). The small individual portions are 1. cute, 2. more hygienic than a big communal pile and 3. allow you to sample more things before feeling too full! It is a little annoying having to juggle all of the tiny plates but I like the concept.\n\nThe seafood station is pretty great with piles and piles of crab. They have awesome mac 'n' cheese and the most fantastic little mini burgers that are packed with flavor. Lots of tasty potato-y sides (truffled scallop potatoes, potato pancakes, tater tots), delicious fried chicken, good pasta, an awesome watermelon-feta salad... good meats, and AWESOME desserts. SAVE ROOM for dessert; they have baklava gelato! And Aztec chocolate and a ridiculous pile of other awesome flavors. There are cookie and candy jars, little mini cakes, soufflés straight out of the oven.\n\nAnyway, from now on I will be taking visitors here as the example of BEST Vegas buffet. The dining room is snazzy, the food is great and there is plenty of it and it displays the kind of (yes) bacchanalian opulence you can only find here.

Also, we couldn't get our own drinks, we had to have the waitress come and bring us coffee and juice. Most of the time, she was nowhere to be found. Fortunately, she saw our beady red eyes and knew to bring us a carafe of coffee. \nThe place was incredibly clean. Every time I made a mess at the buffet (which was often), I was impressed to see that it was cleaned up by the time I went back for more. \nThe music was weird, an Enya-like mix of strange music.

We purchased a travelzoo voucher to receive 2 buffets for $85 which includes unlimited mimosas, beer or wine. After 45 minutes we received our 2nd mimosa....so not worth the $15 charge for the drinks. Oh and that travelzoo voucher does not include tax...fyi. Just as I started to take pictures of all our plates piling up, the server suddenly appeared to clear our table. Absolutely unacceptable. It took forever to receive our water, coffee and that 1st mimosa.\n\nWhy am I being generous then with the 3rd star? Well, they did have hot steamed crablegs on a Sunday at 10am. They also had har gow and shiu mai that were pretty tasty. The only issue with the dimsum is that you had to practically get burned to bend under the window and reach the baskets and then try to lift the lid. It was a dangerous gamble but it paid off. Wonder how many people actually get steam burns though? Their chicken and waffles wasn't bad. But nothing else really stood out other than dim sum, crablegs and jumbo shrimp.

My favorites were the seafood, BBQ, and Mexican section. Everything tasted great and I couldn't get enough of the scallops, that was by far my favorite! One of the best things I liked was that you could get your own juice that they preportioned in bottles. The horchata was amazing as well as the pina, which was made to the perfect sweetness for my taste. After dinner, came dessert, and their dessert selection is no joke either.

They were cooked to glorious medium-rare perfection and seasoned conservatively so that you really taste the flavor of the fresh meat and the crisped outer portion of fat. The lamb wasn't gamey in the least. \n\nDim Sum: The shu mai and har gao were fresh, tender and moist. I can't say that I've had better dim sum anywhere it was that good! The pockets of steamed yumminess practically melted in my mouth they were that tender. \n\nThe raw oysters were incredibly fresh! The meat had a slightly sweet flavor with pleasantly mild brininess. My only quasi-complaint would be that these are located directly next to the crab legs which meant I had to wait in line to get to them. The cold crab legs took some patience to get to since nearly everyone in line was asking for them to be heated up. (Kudos to the chefs and serving staff for complying with every request asked of them!)\n\nThe banana souffle was heavenly! It was served warm and had such simple unpretentious flavor. It wasn't overwhelming because the delicate foamy texture seemed to dissipate the sweetness so that it wasn't concentrated into one bite. \n\n\nThe Good:\nThe sushi was fresh and nothing like any buffet sushi I've ever had. The hand rolls were a nice touch too! I would have liked to have a little more variety in the rolls since it seemed everything had spicy tuna on or in it. \n\nThe ramen noodles weren't what I was expecting after reading some of the other reviews, but I think the other bolder flavored items might have skewed my judgment. I mean they weren't bad but not really a standout to me on this buffet of 500 items.\n\nThe sweet potato fries were tasty. They accompanied a piece of fried chicken that my hubby got, but he doesn't like sweet potatoes so I ended up with them. They were crispy and possibly doused in some sort of maple glaze that created a very nice savory sweet contrast.\n\nThe crab croquettes were surprisingly light. The crab concoction inside them was a delicate blend of fresh crab, bell pepper, onion and seasonings. It reminded me of the very delicate crab cake that I used to get from Commanders Palace. \n\nThe prime rib was seasoned nicely and I really appreciate the fact that it wasn't overcooked. \n\n\nThe Rest:\nThe blackberry pana cotta and the shrimp with grits fall under my \"victims of a buffet\" items. The shrimp with grits had decent flavor but I couldn't get past the hardened dry layer of grits on the top. The blackberry panna cotta had congealed to an undesirable firmness, maybe from the time it stood sitting on the dessert bar. \n\nThe ceviche was too sour and acidic for my taste. It didn't help that I evidently picked up the only cup that lacked a slice of avocado on the top of it. \n\n\nOverall this buffet is well worth the money and I will definitely bring my next out of towners here.

My friends and I thought we'd be safe from the lines if we came for a late brunch, and boy were we wrong- it was still an hour and a half wait when we got there at 1pm on a Sunday, although this was still during the busy Summer months (end of June). We went to the automatic kiosk machine and entered our information, so we could gamble and/or walk around until our table was ready. We ended up getting texted before the 1.5 hour mark, but you still have to stand in line to pay and be seated, which took about 10 minutes from when we got there. Adult Brunch on Sunday costs $43.99, but this includes bottomless mimosas (I don't think there is a way to waive the alcohol if you don't drink). \n\n-Seafood Plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=n-9x_33nc6kufoos1XDSHg#n-9x_33nc6kufoos1XDSHg): The chilled shrimp were amazing- super fresh and huge pieces. Crab legs were good, and you can ask them to steam it quickly if you don't mind waiting for a few minutes. The smaller crab legs were really difficult to eat even though they are partially cracked, but you can ask your server for a small mallet if needed.

The pad thai, green curry, and Chinese style eggplant were good, and the dim sum solid for a buffet (I had the Taro Bun and Pork Dumpling). The donut in the back was REALLY good, so definitely get that fresh if you see them making it. Skip the smoked salmon, which was really salty.

The mango mousse cake and their other cakes were just so-so.\n\nService here was ok- our server was around at first, but there would be times we didn't see her for half an hour or more, and thus couldn't get our mimosa flutes re-filled.

They weren't offering any soft cheeses, since I suppose they're probably harder to hold on a buffet line.\nThe cold seafood station had a good selection from ceviche (delicious) to crab gazpacho (skip it) to mussels (good) and shrimp cocktail (odd texture, but tasty still). They do offer crab legs on the buffet line which are cold. If you're looking for hot crab legs, they have them at the Italian station.\nThe crab legs were the only thing I ate from the Italian station (too many filling carbs) and they were pre-split, which did make them easier to eat, but it also affected the flavor since they were boiled after they were already split. Just a mention: they're a mix of snow and king, with no option between the two. You get what you get, and there's definitely more snow than king.\nThe Asian section had congee, steamed buns and dumplings (the shrimp har gow were delicate and delicious), pho, sushi, stir fries and noodles.\nThe carving station had some really charismatic people working the line that I thoroughly enjoyed serving up prime rib, sausages, smoked brisket and- of course- turkey! Everything was delicious, although they could offer some creamed horseradish rather than just the fresh horseradish at the cold seafood station.\n\nBy far the most amazing part of this buffet are their desserts. I'm not really a dessert person, but I couldn't stop myself. I tried, well, I think everything. DO NOT MISS: The passion fruit tarts! The gelato- I had the Fleur de Sel vanilla and Brown Ale Caramel. The two on their own? AMAZING! But together... epic!\n\nIf you're a buffet person, Bacchanal is reputed to be the best on the strip, most likely because it's the newest, and it is an impressive spread. But for $70 p/p? I'd rather have a meal with service.","review_id":"ube_O1NBrP8Eizd28-O3TA","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":2,"useful":3,"user_id":"Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw","date":"2013-12-05"},{"cool":1,"text":"This place is definitely as good as it gets. Yes, it's pricey but it's Vegas and it's a buffet. Cost is to be expected, right? But the nice surprise here is how legit this place is. It's not your everyday casino buffet. The quality and presentation of the food here is top notch. You feel like a kid in a candy store here so trust me, take your time and get a little bit of everything. Seriously, one or two shrimps at a time...you need the room on your plate to try everything else. Their prime rib was tender, crab legs were meaty, oysters were fresh, filler foods (mac n cheese, scalloped potatoes, sweet potato fries, etc.) were all deliciously sinful as they should be. Don't forget that there's a whole other side tucked to the back left corner. It was a whole new world when our table discovered it. Desserts were gourmet quality and the ice cream flavors were fun like french toast, thai tea and watermelon mint. Bonus points for having mochi ice cream at their dessert bar. \n\nService was super pleasant and very fast.

This time around was sweeter. A self check-in kiosk met us as we tried getting in line which asked for a name and a cellphone number for them to reach us when it's time to pay and get seated. 30 minutes of trying our luck with the slot machines and my phone beeped saying it was time. \n\nTime to get our glutton on, that's what!\n\nI always scope out the different stations categorized by cuisines before getting anything. I've finally learned to skip the bacon and other breakfast items I can eat at home so I started with some dim sum, roasted duck, and hot and sour soup. Can I say that was the best SIUMAI I've had just yet? It's remarkably tasty and perfect in texture from all aspects. Try it and thank me later! Meanwhile, the duck was great but the hot and sour soup could use less salt.\n\nThere's a long line for the seafood station so I went for the carving station for a nice slab of PRIME RIB (yuummmm!) and got me some of the best SCALLOPED POTATOES with MUSHROOMS from another part of the buffet. Wow! I got two pans of these buttery and flavorful carbs. Soooooo gooooood! I was told the LAMB CHOPS would be dished out around 3pm but by then I was already too full. Something to try next time, that's for sure. \n\nOffering a selection of soups, I had their tomato basil soup, very delish, and their mushroom with truffle soup, very salty! Next to it is their bread station and take heed when I say get their mini CORN BREAD muffins. Mmmhmmm!\n\nI finally lined up for the seafood station to start burning what I ate. Mussels, clams, salmon, and seafood paella were the hot ones that I partook. I forgot to return for the shrimp and grits but those looked good. Cajun crawfish was also some of the offerings I decided to skip on due to the eating logistics of that crustacean. However, I certainly could not pass up on the oyster shooters, cocktail shrimps, KING CRAB LEGS, and their fresh succulent oysters. I recommend everything I tried in this station, however, I thought the paella was just alright and was on the salty side.\n\nEnding this gluttonous meal on a sweet note, I will have to say that among all the beautiful looking pastries and sweets I've tried, what's really worth indulging in are their CREPES! They have a station where they make it fresh for you with your own choosing of toppings such as sugar, syrup, and fruits. The texture and flavor is spot on. It's so good I could easily eat it by itself! Or, you can pair with it any gelato of your liking with so many flavors to choose from, if it rocks your boat. \n\nIf there's anything that didn't impress me other than a few over-seasoned items, it would sadly have to be the service rendered to us by our server. She was an older lady who was somehow kind and very accommodating to all the tables around us, but us. She seemed cold, always rushing without stopping to hear what we're requesting. When she was leaving, she said, \"My shift is done, I want to go home now! You want anything else?\" And it wasn't in a friendly way. She moved on to the next table and got all friendly to them endorsing the server who was to take care of them when she leaves. And this is why you should tip only after you've been served.   \n\nBottomline, we were all happy with what we consumed despite the price tag it came with ($50 for weekend champagne brunch). Because we got seated around 2pm, we were able to enjoy some dishes that were served only for dinner such as the fresh oysters. Either way, I guarantee you will leave this place satiated not just with the quantity of food you'll get but with a quality worth noting.","review_id":"Qj0o7z_vRW3Q4PPU7hs62w","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":27,"useful":33,"user_id":"kFtpOzWygqAENd6oKrkefw","date":"2014-10-08"},{"cool":0,"text":"I PROS | \n- Spacious and clean!! \n- Best quality of food. \n- Get the shrimp!

First- the line here holy crap!  This is not joke, plan ahead to wait and wait and wait.  Luckily you can check in then head back to your room until you get a text saying its time to wait in line (which will take at least another hour).  Its on the expensive side, but there are definitely more pricey ones out there.  I went for Sunday brunch, and the selection was outstanding!  This buffet is HUGE, I have never seen one so large.  Some of the items are outstanding while others are pretty bad.  The ethnic selection is great, but some of the foods are so BLAND it almost doesn't matter.  But for the price you really cant beat it when you get some good quality items.  The fresh boiled crab legs (not the ones at the seafood station) are a hidden gem that it seemed like not many people knew about.  The ramen station was really delicious as well.  They had fresh oysters but the line to get that was too long, sorry after waiting forever I was not interested in fighting people over oysters.  The crab claws were pretty horrible, probably the most disappointing thing I ate, they were still frozen, and full of water.  So disappointing!  They did have bottomless champagne and a bunch of fun juices to choose from.  The dessert bar was huge, I couldn't eat any more so I cant comment on the quality of the desserts, but they certainly look good.  \n\n5 stars for being the top buffet in vegas without higher prices!","review_id":"0_ftrTEBFz57uqBRoAVv5Q","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"z72bj7TDPCi0Sovmsm4KOw","date":"2014-12-01"},{"cool":2,"text":"The best buffet I've been to (i've yet to try Bally's Sterling Brunch).

The seasoning on the lab chops is perfect. \n\nThe final stop is the dessert bar. They probably have over 75 different varieties of desserts and fruits.

There is NO line for the hot ones. I repeat NO LINE for HOT CRAB legs, so go there first if you only want them hot.

I enjoyed the Shrimp and crab but not the lobster corn chowder from the seafood station. The Deserts are very cool and all bases are covered. The Peanut butter and chocolate pop was my favorite, but the Oreo mousse was also delish!\n \nI had 6 small plates including desert all were good or better, service was efficient and friendly, what more can you ask for. As far as value it was fine, I knew the price and never felt cheated.\n\nWill I return, you bet, only for dinner! and we shall have wine and celebrate the abundance of food before us!!!

Regular price is $21.95 but I used a free comp.\n\n\n It's about time the mother ship stepped up it's buffet game !!!   It's quite the spread and to be honest, i need to hit it again soon to get the proper order of all the different cuisines - it wold be very difficult for anyone to try a sample of even 1/2 of what's offered.\n\n Started on the one end which was the Asian section - some dim sum items, including soup dumplings, duck, bbq pork, a very tasty aspargus beef dish, noodle soup, rice dishes, etc etc; But - I did not try any of the sush selections ( next time ..)  then a salad bar area which i wisked by rather quickly ( along with the mediterranean section )  especially since there was a cheese area screaming out to me - reggiano and the maytag blue was amazing !  Next was an italian section that included meats/sausage, about four different pastas, pizza ( loved the anchovy topping  ) a cast iron pan filled with tasty meatballs, etc etc\n\nturn the corner and i see an interesting collection of mexican foods - my fav was the homemade tortillas with some carnitas. I did not try some of the stews but they looked incredible ( next time ... ) \n\nSome of the other highlights -\n\n the carving station - the ribs, sasuage, the beef. I didn't try the turkey ( next time ...)\nnext to the carving station were some nice BBQ styled sides - beans, grilled corn, several potato options and the downer of the day - a sorry ass pan of mac and cheese - with all these awesome cheeses on the line , they couldn't make the effort to give us a decent mac and cheese ?!?\n\nthe seafood section - props for having stone crabs but a pain in the booty to get to da meat !  Lobster corn chowder was amazing.  By the time i hit this station i was so overwelmed i didn't notice if they had king crab which is kinda pathetic on my part because I LOVE KING CRAB ....I'm embarassed.\n\ndesserts - i didn't come close to giving ths station justice - i was sooo full.  but i did notice the crepe station ( not really my thing ), interesting ice creams - i made a mini banana foster for the gf - she loved it even though the bananas were not fully \"carmelized\"  - i tried a small scoop of berry cobbler and bread pudding - excellent !  next time, small scoop of ice cream on the cobbler.\n\nservice was excellent.  space had a nice feel to it.

I would rather pay more to get higher quality food made to order instead of sitting under heat lamps for hours with people walking by and coughing in their general direction. That said, this is one of the least bad buffets I have ever been to, the other one that still exists being Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo. There's also the one that no longer exists, the Rio seafood buffet BEFORE it started to suck (back in the early 2000s; I got married and brought my husband years later but all the seafood smelled and tasted totally rancid) -- since it sucks now, I can't count that one anymore.\n\nSo which to choose? Depends on what you want. The Asian food was better at Bacchanal, while the Wicked Spoon's Asian food was terrible. Bacchanal has some small selection of okay dim sum and made-to-order noodles (udon, ramen, pho, and even laksa, which I haven't seen at a buffet before). The Wicked Spoon had better prime rib and other cutting station meats, and had ribeye steak, which Bacchanal does not have. Both have lots of tiny cute desserts, but Bacchanal has daan tat (Chinese egg tarts). They had a puff pastry shell instead of the usual crust which is like a cross between puff pastry and harder, shortbread-like pie crust.\n\nThe best things Bacchanal had to offer were\n\n2.) Suckling pig with crispy skin - really fatty and delicious and not sweet at all.\n\nand oddly enough the best thing there was\n\n1.) Mashed potatoes with gravy - seriously, I know that is a weird thing to single out because you can get this anywhere but they must put crack in the gravy because I was sucking it off my fingers and debating licking it off my plate when no one was looking.\n\nFinally, like I said about the Wicked Spoon, to me it's worth going just once to experience it. But like all the high-end buffets, it costs more money than it's worth, and is also not worth the 2+ hour wait. We only managed to get away with just a 5-minute wait to get in because it was on an off day (mid-week) in the off season (winter, between Thanksgiving and Christmas) at an off time of day, between 2-3pm.\n\nNow we only have one more buffet to cross off our Vegas buffet list, the Sterling champagne brunch, and then I never have to eat at another buffet for as long as I live.","review_id":"aQVjMlxoOdalnnzmfRn-cQ","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"SkGhMBBRcvKq3bwjcjbs_w","date":"2016-12-21"},{"cool":12,"text":"I have tried almost every buffet on the strip.\n\nDecided to take the hit and paid $50 for dinner.\n\nBacchanal is definitely the best on the strip.

Jumbo shrimp, king crab, tiny lobster, sushi that is not full of rice, noodle soup that actually tastes very good, very delicious dessert, etc.\n\nThey even take a picture of you before you enter like it's an attraction.\n\nBUT I can't recommend it at $50.  The value is just not there.  You will be just as happy at the Wicked Spoon or the Wynn buffet or the Bellagio buffet for 20%+ less.\n\nYou'll be busy trying to get your moneys worth.  The people around me were done eating, but it seemed like they were waiting to digest so they can fit in more.  The receipt states to \"please limit your stay to 2 hours\"\n\nThe restroom is to the right of the exit and yes, you can re-enter after you unload.\n\nYour friends will be excited to go, but won't talk about how good it was.

The fresh chunks of corn really add a surprising bite and sweetness.\n\nMuscles - Fresh, not over done and great with a squeeze of fresh lemon.\n\nRoasted Duck - FULL of flavor.  Fatty and duck-y... just how it should be.  Goes great with rice, but rice fills you up quick\n\nJapanese Seaweed Salad - Full of sesame flavor.  Texturally this salad is just simply fun to eat.\n\nCrab Legs - Not too salty, which i adore.  Don't forget the clarified butter!! It's great because these legs already come split lengthwise making it much easier to eat.\n\nAssortment of cured meats, cheese, and dried fruit.\n\nPecan Tart - Buttery and rich.  Crumbly and butter crust.  One of my favorites\n\nTiramisu - It's almost hard not to f***k this dessert up.  Love the espresso flavor.\n\nNOT SO GOOD\n\nBrisket - Over-smoked in my opinion.  I personally like a light smoke ring around my brisket, but this was just SATURATED in smoke.\n\nPrime Rib - DON'T FORGET TO ASK THEM TO POUR SOME AU JUS OVER YOUR CUT.  The meat itself is tasteless without it.\n\nBBQ Ribs - Again, heavy on the smoke flavor.  Would've been great if it wasn't for such a heavy smoke ring.\n\nChinese Selection - Ok, I'm just saying this because I'm not a fan of Chinese food (I'm asian if you're wondering).  I tried every Chinese dish they offered, but every dish tasted similar to each other.  I mean, the Chinese dishes were pretty straight forward in flavor.\n\nItalian Selection - Stray away from this section because it is extremely HEAVY with CARBS.\n\nSushi - No matter what buffet I go to the raw sushi is never that good.  The rice was saturated in rice wine vinegar and the fish wasn't of the greatest quality.\n\nOVERALL:  I could go on and one but these are just the few that stick out.  If you're looking for a buffet that has a HUGE selection of food, look elsewhere such as the Rio or the M Buffet.  \n\nLike I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!","review_id":"RQhcBH4qLbUG5wELqQPuPA","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"M46t0gV5doOlr87TZHPfrw","date":"2013-01-06"},{"cool":2,"text":"You should let the hype wear off a bit. It's so popular right now they packed the place to the brim with tables. It's hard to get around and tell where the food is. The plates come in two sizes: small and less small. Many dishes are on single serving dishes. Three fit on a plate. So I transferred my food over to my plate leaving behind the dish. I felt like a jerk leaving a stack of tiny dishes behind, but it's so hard to get through all the tables to my table that I wanted to minimize the amount of times I walked back and forth. The major con of this is my food got cold. My food got cold because the buffet is so busy that you have to wait at each station. It is true that many items were indeed mislabeled or not labeled at all. But the food was great! And the people that work there, despite being pushed to the limits of being busy, provided excellent customer service.\n\nNow on to the food. \nMust have:\nBoth varieties of Mac & Cheese- it's sinful, oily, rich. One with crispy cheese on top. The other with crunchy bread crumbs.\nPrime Rib with the Sauce- the meat was red and juicy. Make sure you eat the fat. Beware, I had to wait many minutes to get to this station.\nSliders- cooked to medium, oozing cheese. Looks like some were not as good as others though so choose wisely.\nAll the Dim Sum- I could eat a million sesame balls.\nFlavored Honeys- Get a piece of bread (it's everywhere) and dip. The vanilla honey was the bees knees.\n\nOverhyped:\nCrab Legs- They are cut in half and still frozen. I don't know if it's just me, but every time I have them cut in half they taste way too salty. Try to find the claw pieces. At least they are sweet.\nShrimp and Grits- The grits seemed undercooked and flavorless. The flavor combo is more impressive on paper.\n\nBut the thing that really made my experience was the DESSERT section. No other place can compare. I should have eaten dessert all night. PHENOMENAL. It's far better in terms of variety AND quality than Studio B.\nMacaroons in many flavors. Perfect, the way the outside caves in to a chewy mild flavor. I ate 3.\nGelato flavor like no one else. I had one scoop each of 3 flavors because it was offered to me (what a nice guy). The butter caramel is rich, but didn't compare to my other two flavors. Balsamic and Fig had chunks of sticky fig, harmonious. The best was the Aztec Chocolate. Spicy, chocolate, complex flavor that pleasantly lingers on the tongue.\nSoufflé made fresh. It was still rising when she handed it me. You have to find the sign on top the bar and ask for it. I thank the kind stranger who guided me to it. The soufflé was hot and gooey inside with a subtle banana flavor.\nReal marshmallows! Totally not obnoxious. They were light and sugary. I had a single pink one.\nSome tiny cone filled with chocolate pudding? On a stick. Whoa, dunno what it was, but delicious. It tasted like they snuck a tiny bit of salt in it.\nThree varieties of Crème Brulee: vanilla, chocolate, and hazelnut. I chose hazelnut. I couldn't taste the hazelnut, but the texture was spot on.","review_id":"T1cNbeR65hhfPl7tbgh31Q","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":2,"useful":3,"user_id":"mxwMqra7TEZ6K4ML3DgPmA","date":"2012-09-22"},{"cool":0,"text":"Totally overhyped!!!!!\n\nGood Buffet so far but let me Tell you we went to few openings wynn, cosmopolitan & every Buffet was good when they opened but After few Weeks prices went up quality down very sad& Bad. :-(\n\nThe line for Lunch was about 1 Hour on a monday.

Having said that, and very much like virtually all of the other Vegas buffets that I've visited, the quality is good not great. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nI'll get right to the point here: if you arrive at Bacchanal before 1000 it's unlikely that you'll wait in line, but if you arrive after 1000 be prepared to wait maybe fifteen minutes and if you arrive after 1100? Good luck - you're looking at 30 minutes plus easy. \n\nOnce seated, the service is a tad bit hit or miss depending on your server. At times our very nice server was fantastically attentive while at other times we'd run out of water. Besides that, the logistics are pretty straight forward if not overwhelming. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nThe buffet at Bacchanal is $50.00 without booze, which is reasonably priced, so expect to pay in the ballpark of $70.00 if you're going to have drinks after tax and tip. That's expensive, but given the breadth here at Bacchanal, the location, and the popularity you really shouldn't be surprised. Star Granted.\n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nAs I alluded to earlier, the selection at Bacchanal can't be beat, and I need to give a particular shout out to the excellent Asian selection and the soup station. \n\nHaving said that, there wasn't a single dish (and I got virtually all of them) at Bacchanal that really blew me away. The traditional breakfast foods? Good, not great. The seafood? Good, not great. The desserts? Weak. It was the Asian that was on par with what you'd find at a pretty good Asian restaurant, but even that was a bit hit or miss. I'm about quality over quantity, and Bacchanal fell a bit short in the quality department in my opinion. Single Star Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nBacchanal is impressive, and you should absolutely pay them a visit, but it's not my favorite Vegas buffet and there aren't any dishes that in my opinion are superior to what you'd find at a specialty spot.

More importantly, its worth it for the quality and selection of food.\n\nEven though the line for lunch looked worse than the line for Space Mountain at Disneyland, I timed it, and it was about a ten minute wait time.  It was $30 for lunch, or $36 including tip, which you can add at the cash register.\n\nOne of the things that I like about this buffet is that they do a few dishes for each type of food, and they do them (mostly) well.  There isn't that sense of trying to offer every single dish known to man (Rio buffet, I'm looking at you!) at the expense of the quality of food.  The other thing that I really like (okay, love) are the desserts.  The desserts are plentiful, and taste like they're straight from a bakery.\n\nMy highlights were the pesto pasta (REALLY good pasta), chorizo with potatoes, beef sliders, and the sorbet.  The sweet potato fries also deserve special recognition for having just the right amount of crispiness.  (Not to be confused with the sweet potato tater tots; those had a weird glaze on top that tasted too sweet.)  I also LOVE the watermelon fruit juice, which oddly, is located in the seafood section.  \n\nI've also heard that the Pho is awesome here, but I didn't get a chance to try it on my last visit.

Brunch is $39 and dinner is ~$59. Brunch still has crab claw legs, shrimp, crawfish, and prime rib so it's still worth it if you're eyeing the seafood like many of us are. \n\nThe dessert bar has some things made to order like these thai tea shots. The thai tea is in a little shot glass with boba on the bottom and a small scoop of ice cream on top. They also have a chocolate soufflé that takes about 8-10minutes to bake, and honestly, it's not the greatest. I would prefer the matcha green tea cakes or any of their other excellent desserts.","review_id":"RwzuF8ocWi_Z5yQUc-TXOA","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":3,"useful":6,"user_id":"hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g","date":"2017-03-23"},{"cool":4,"text":"Maybe my expectations were set too high prior to coming to this buffet but my experience did not meet my expectations and I most-likely would not come back unless a big group of my friends come and I am forced to be with the group.\n\nThe food was good- don't get me wrong.

The lamb chops were cooked perfectly - medium rare to medium.   All of the food stations had general favorites along with more authentic options.

You can bring a fork with you too so when you first make your way through the hot seafood items, you can snack on the halibut, salmon, crab croquette, lobster corn chowder.

Caesars' Bacchanal Buffet is THE BEST BUFFET IN VEGAS (and perhaps the world based on the United Nations of diners eating or queued up in line waiting to get in)!  After our aborted attempt to have our Thanksgiving dinner at Bacchanal Buffet, my parents, the gf and I went there for brunch on a Friday late-morning/early afternoon.  The line to get in was very long, but moved reasonably fast and we were seated after a 40-minute wait.  Since it was a holiday weekend, diners were limited to two hour stay...not that I could eat for two hours without bursting a la Mr. Creosote in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life.\n\nThe dining room is modern, bright, but not as large as you'd expect.  The dominant, and most important, features are the long, multi-station buffet line that runs along the exterior and the dessert buffet station in the center of the dining room.  What makes Bacchanal Buffet stand out is that the quality and execution of food on the buffet line is amazingly high especially when you consider the sheer volume of food being prepared.  The ingredients are exceedingly fresh and incorporated into items that are made fresh daily, if not continually.  While you certainly pay a price ($44 for brunch, $50 for dinner), Bacchanal Buffet doesn't cut corners in terms of diversity of selection and gross quantity on the its buffet line. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g?select=XF8wOzssRcIpzTJkOIa5fQ#ewLgq_cCjrvvVHePLFtF8g http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g?select=XF8wOzssRcIpzTJkOIa5fQ#O3vEnr2Kj_GXz0BlOpYOmg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g?select=XF8wOzssRcIpzTJkOIa5fQ#4c_IwHr_y8XjodmKWJ41HA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g?select=XF8wOzssRcIpzTJkOIa5fQ#RZ7vhOqOXm6qqhc9qiS2_A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g?select=XF8wOzssRcIpzTJkOIa5fQ#J91YSDvd5u6qEGdnwDbjZw Since we were there before 1 pm, the buffet offered breakfast items such as made-to-order omelets and crepes.

Charcuterie and cheeses?  Check!  Grilled and roasted meats?  Check!  Food highlights:  the Posole Rojo, which was nicely seasoned spicy; the Machaca con Salsa; the meaty Alaskan King Crab Legs warmed upon request; the chilled, peeled shrimp; Sticky Rice wrapped in a lotus leaf; and what appeared to be a very tasty interpretation of Xiao Long Bao, a broth-filled dumpling.  \n\nThe Bacchanal Buffet epitomizes American (and Vegas) excess...in a good way.  While I certainly won't confuse it with a fine dining experience, the food is better than the majority of restaurants on the Strip.  Is it too much of a good thing?

The first station I hit up was the Asian food station. The chow mein was pretty incredible and so was their mini bowl of Vietnamese beef pho. I worked my way to the Mexican station and enjoyed their green chili enchiladas. The bbq station was pretty standard since I think a bbq tastes the same, however, the hot sausage links were so amazing, I went back for a second helping of it. Now for my favorite: Dessert. I made sure to save room because the dessert station was heavily covered with every type of tasty delight you could imagine. I tried the pumpkin pie, the pecan pie, the key lime custard, chocolate mousse, raspberry parfait, and the gelato. Let me tell you about the gelato. Guava was delicious, honey was very unique, and the balsamic gelato (after acquiring some taste for it) is rather addictive. It is one of the few buffets on the strip that is worth every penny. Just make sure you get in line during an off-peak hour or you will be in line for forever and go on an empty stomach.","review_id":"2gA2YbWZ3UdYJNbz4G67PA","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"F0nR2cEBLSZtBb2hlxnpoA","date":"2013-01-19"},{"cool":1,"text":"I've been here twice.

No, I am not getting paid for this, I promise ;)\n\nI'm not a huge fan of any the buffets in Vegas. I've never really liked Studio B Buffet (M Hotel) or Wicked Spoon. I only think Studio B is worth it when it's cheap (ie Friday lunch). \n\nOn a Sunday evening, we stood in line starting at around 5:15 and didn't get seated until close to 6:30. Cost is average to what you normally pay at buffets, about $45-60? I think we got a decent discount for using our Total Rewards card. \n\nSeafood - AMAZING! Oh so fresh & delicious - halibut (buttery & melts in your mouth) & sashimi (restaurant quality, fresh tasting). Everything else was just as great! Lots of stuff to choose from. Dessert section was probably my favorite, I wanted to eat EVERYTHING!! I loved the fresh souffle, made to order crepes and  large selection of gelato ice cream flavors. Another plus, food presentation! :P\n\nWait and price for Bacchanal was well worth it! I'd go again ;) My only concern is that Bacchanal is indeed new and hasn't been opened (or re-opened) for a long time, so I am worried that the quality might not stay for long.

Save the best review for last. LOL! Right off not much of buffet person in general but the last two trips at buffet. Like to think hit current top two Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal. Not so entirely different besides the obvious both PRICEY although Wicked Spoon save little bit. Thankfully got here super early so no dealing with horror stories of long waits or find that fast pass get in and out. I guess some card program or whatever jump ahead in line. Still always hook. This one sure you go in separate line still have wait so really that much faster?? Best advice go early if want to avoid lines. Thankfully my friends visiting had good day gambling so never had pay the ridiculous price for dinner. \n\nThe food I had nothing but praise for the diversity of food! Somethings that found never seen before at a buffet. The ramen station. On this night never got any cause the person working the station was non existence or even was at the station had back turned seem disinterested checking for customers. Needless too say never tried any. They had station of freshly squeezed juices in little kraft glasses all on ice and nice setup. Horchata as one of the choices found interesting. I went with the guava tasted really refreshing and good. The cold seafood section with the snow crab legs not often you see. I think snow crab legs are over rated besides lot of work get meat out. I rather stick with the crab legs. The craving station was mile high of meats from prime rib, sausage, brisket, and sure missing couple more. The sushi station though great was rolls not just your standard fare ones but spicy tuna and not just bland ones. The nigiri looked pretty good (tasted pretty solid for buffet) and again more then just your standard ones. The charcuterie station with meats and cheeses and breads. Something hardly see in buffets. Thumbs up! Ethic stations or trend in buffets got your italian station, asian station, and so on. Some hit or misses but its buffet with that many options it is what it is. The dessert station again like the diversity. They even make fresh crepes. I was way full get any. Overall the food here is really good and although paying for it like to think getting the quality in the price.\n\nThe things dislike. I think the tables are WAY too close to one another. I felt like eating in cafeteria at times. Three of us. The next round table literally tight fit turn the table around so  one of my friends could slide her chair in and out. Our server not the quickest came getting our drinks and keeping them filled. The location it tucked in the back. So if not sure Bacchanal can be hard to find.","review_id":"s75Tmx1mYiiaIW7MrDtoiQ","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":2,"useful":2,"user_id":"iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q","date":"2014-08-21"},{"cool":2,"text":"WOW, I can't believe I ate for 3 hours, nonstop. I just HAD to try almost everything they had to offer. Damn that \"get more bang for your buck\" mentality!!!!! \n\nIn my opinion, Studio B at the M hotel and Bellagio were my top buffets in vegas. Yes, even Wynn and Wicked Spoon at the cosmopolitan cannot compare. This buffet is definitely on par with Studio B and Bellagio. I'm going to list out how the top buffets rank in comparison to each other for each category and let you decide where you want to try for yourself. (1 = best)\n\nCarving Station: 1. Studio B, 2. Bacchanal, 3. Bellagio\nSeafood: 1. Bacchanal, 2. Studio B, 3. Bellagio\nAsian: 1. Bacchanal, 2. Studio B, 3. Bellagio\nBBQ: 1. Bellagio, 2. Bacchanal, 3. Studio B\nSalad (who comes to this station anyway?): 1. Studio B, 2. Bacchanal, 3. Bellagio\nItalian: 1. Bellagio, 2. Bacchanal, 3. Studio B\nAmerican: 1. Bellagio, 2. Bacchanal, 3. Studio B\nDessert: 1. Bacchanal, 2. Bellagio, 3. Studio B\n\nAs you can see, they all have their goods and not so goods. It just depends on what you're craving. I will say that Bellagio's buffet is smaller in size so they do not have as much variety, but you can count on their quality. Everything they put out will be good whereas quality decreases as Studio B and Bacchanal offer more quantity. Also, Studio B includes all you can drink beer and champagne whereas Bacchanal has fresh squeeze juices (orange, carrot, tropical, and watermelon)\n\nLast tips, its $46/person for a holiday brunch, but it's $2 off/person if you're a total rewards member. Also, no lines before 11:30am for brunch! I hear their line goes round and round and round!\n\nBy the end of the 3rd hour, all foods taste the same. Trust me, I don't think you'd want to eat anymore.

I'm positive you have spent hours in line waiting for worse things- rides at Disney, movies that ended up sucking, visiting your mom- Bacchanal is one line that actually pays off in food. Also, if you are willing to throw down some bribes you will find yourself waiting in line a lot less time.\n\nI hate gross trough buffets....\nNot really a question Karen (its always a Karen asking this)- but don't you worry your little highlighted head about it. Bacchanal makes almost everything in small plate form so you aren't scooping out wods of 8 hour old scrambled eggs onto your plate to go with your mini triangle waffles. They have a lot of stations where food is prepared fresh for you, and if something sits too long they take it back. \n\nSeems a little pricey\nIf this is the biggest waste of money you have in Vegas than you have gotten off easy. Gambling, strippers, gambling with strippers- you don't even get to walk away with a feeling of full from these things, at Bacchanal not only do you get that but you get free bonus gifts: diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and weight gain- FREE! But seriously, its not that much more expensive than other similar buffets but it is preposterously better. \n\nI'm staying at a different casino that's far away...\nWell then your travel agent sucks.

The breakfast fine print stipulated that you had to arrive before 10:30AM I believe, and we strolled in exactly around that time. The VIP pass to skip the GA line came in handy (it looked like an awfully long wait for them). \n\nArriving just in the nick of time actually worked out fabulously. My husband and I got to try out Bacchanal's breakfast AND lunch options! We agreed beforehand I would be the DD, so he was free to pound down the mimosas. I was afraid staff would hold back on refilling mimosas, but they kept our glasses flowing. Mimosas for days, yo!\n\nService overall was awesome. Plates were cleared and refills were constantly given. Staff was friendly too!  \n\nBUFFET HIGHLIGHTS: I really enjoyed the hash browns and eggs for breakfast. For lunch, I liked the wild mushroom pizza, wonderfully cheesy mac 'n cheese and broccoli, and the caprese salad. For dessert, I liked these fancy, rich, chocolate pieces decorated with slivers of nuts and pearlescent balls. \n\nI sampled just about every section in the Bacchanal Buffet but was disappointed that the buffet wasn't very vegetarian friendly. Especially in the Hispanic and Asian ethnic food sections, vegetarian choices were severely lacking. \n\nWorth a Return Visit?\nBacchanal is a nice buffet, but I still prefer the buffet at the Wynn because it's more vegetarian friendly.

Since I knew we were most likely never coming back we went at the crossover to see the dinner difference.  Indeed, putting out the lamb chops was the difference.  The lamb chops while good were grilled to a medium well.  In my opinion and most chefs lamb should be served medium rare.  For a place trying to be fancy, it was these kind of missteps consistently.  Everything was good, but missed the mark of an upscale experience.  The sushi was the worst.   It seems someone set it beside a heat lamp because it was luke warm.  The crepes were good, but I prefer the banana foster fresh and not a cold garnish.  We were in a VIP section and had the worst waitress ever.   No silverware.  Then she kept taking silver ware.  My friend was actually eating dessert and a soda refill was good offered and she left without waiting for the coffee request and we had to flag her down.

I underestimated their pho/ramen/udon (geez tons of noodle bowl choices right?) but wow they were even better than a cheap Asian restaurant! \n\nI went straight to the crab legs! Theres stacks and stacks of crab and it is all FRESH! So happy they cut it open for you, so all you have to do is, EAT! \nWe were there for breakfast continuing onto lunch and their eggs and sausage were so tasty! They keep the food vibrant in color and it honestly tastes as good as it looks. \n\nThere was a cute little chili dog station with fries, and sweet potatoes. The meat station with ribs and prime rib was pretty popular, but I didn't feel like eating that. It was nice to see the Mexican, pizza and soup and salad stations, but I just ate the crabs and went straight to the desserts right after! \n\nTheir gelato wasn't too impressive. But their cakes were! I am a sucker for Pan Cotta and they had amazing pan cotta trio with chocolate and mango! \n\nHonestly you need to experience this place for yourself! You would feel like you're in FOOD HEAVEN here!","review_id":"5V_4PANvbWg4K5Z1GRo4KA","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":9,"user_id":"pmKnNkGVgzhMkwJaTU5apA","date":"2013-07-17"},{"cool":7,"text":"First of all, I'm not a big buffet person, so I may be biased, but I had high expectations of Bacchanal after all the rave reviews, and was quite disappointed. \n\nWe got there early for dinner on a Friday, and it was not packed at all. The decor and everything was quite nice, well presented. I didn't really care for our chairs that were like big sofa chairs with arm rests, making it hard to get in and out.\n\nThe food was just so-so, nothing that really stood out. The meat was either overcooked, or fish was just not tasty, crab was mushy, oysters were dry. I actually thought the pizza at Bellagio buffet was way better, and the only thing I really liked here were the soup dumplings, various cheeses, the nachos, and desserts. Clearly, not worth $60+! I would have to say the macarons and iced thai boba were clear favorites from the desserts.\n\nOverall, I would rather have one nice meal, than so-so foods at this price.","review_id":"A6XR7hVnh6N9dVMydnauvw","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":5,"useful":10,"user_id":"iCYMf_sHRevmzWg8la-LVw","date":"2016-03-14"},{"cool":3,"text":"Been here twice, both good experiences. \n\nAs a tourist, it's a definite must on your Vegas to-do list. But beware bc it's super popular. My family and I couldn't even get a ticket on our first attempt because the kiosks where you have to enter your name/info as a reservation wasn't even taking reservations bc they were at capacity for the next four or five hours! for our second attempt, we waited about 3 hours before being seated. \n\nIf you're unfamiliar with how it works, you have to physically walk in and make a reservation on their kiosk. Then the ticket that pops out tells you when to arrive to physically wait in line (usually anywhere from 1-3 hours. So you're free to wander the casino until the scheduled time stated on your ticket). Once the designated time arrives, you have to wait in line for maybe another hour. Then you advance slowly like at a line at an amusement park, then there's the final line where you wait for a host to seat you. So there's like three tiers of waiting... \n\nAnyways, food is amazing. High quality ingredients, cooked well, and the service is friendly too (though somewhat frazzled. The waitstaff is sometimes hard to catch, but the servers serving the food are friendly & polite). Also, great desserts! I had the thai tea with boba & ice cream, sooooo good! \n\nOne of my favorites is the cheese selection. :) the Chinese food is good too (recommend the non steamed dishes, like their oxtail is delicious. Don't get the steamed stuff, like soup dumplings, because steamed soup dumplings are meant to be eaten immediately, and these have been sitting out for ten min or more, and so they get dried out with a tough skin), but since I eat awesome Chinese food on a regular basis, I skip that. I love their meatballs, and their Mexican street tacos. The meat, sausage section is delicious, and my slab of bacon was indeed a slab of bacon. Feel free to ask for a half, or a third, of a sausage link as they are very filling. My second time I went for brunch and they had lobster eggs benedict. I'm an eggs benedict junkie, so that was awesome. \n\nSome downsides, in addition to the wait, is that people/patrons are so rushed. I don't like the weird frenetic pace or mindset people have when eating there. Also, the toilets are gross because people \"unload\" (ie puke) there to eat more.... Ugh. So if you don't want to lose your appetite, avoid the bathroom right outside the buffet. \n\nAnyways, if you're a local, you're probably not even reading yelp reviews on Bacchanal because once (or twice) is probably enough. If you're a tourist, it's worth the wait & expense.","review_id":"jp4tDBPZAyEJqNCR9edh6Q","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":2,"useful":6,"user_id":"mHp4g3_z2dmD9UPXzuE8bQ","date":"2015-08-13"},{"cool":1,"text":"Ahhhhhh someone please take me back!!! And I apologize in advance because I know this review is going to be very long...but it is a HUGE buffet so don't blame me, blame Bacchanal :) \n\nIf you are short on time just know..this buffet is WORTH VISITING. I was pretty skeptical by all the great reviews and the yelper's never lie..now for the people who would like to know what there is to have at this buffet: keep reading! \n\nOk, I swear I'm not all over it because I'm asian but I can say i was genuinely impressed with the selection of asian food they had. The dim sum, multiple different soups varying from rice porridge, miso soup, hot and sour, won ton soup, ramen, and a curry type soup. Not only was the selection huge but the quality was great. I was really excited when I saw the korean bbq but it was a little tendon-y for my taste...\nHighlights: seaweed salad, roast duck, rice porridge, and all the dim sum items.\n\nLarge assortment of deli meats that I didn't get to try because I was stuffing my face with other things. Same thing apples to the italian/pizza station. I did try some of the meatballs and the tortellini. They were both tasty but neither \"wow-ed\" me. \n\nNext to the mexican station were probably 20-25 different types of salsa, yummmmyyyyy\n\nOk, the meat station...they probably need more than one guy working this station but I was one of the lucky gal's that tasted the brisket...man is that brisket the best brisket and meat and fat I have EVER tasted. Not that anyone has to convince me to go back to Bacchanal, but I would go back for the brisket period. I also had the ham but the ham was nothing compared to the brisket. On my next visit I hope to see chicken breast instead of whole chicken where you pick your pieces. I just try to avoid bones when possible...\n\nThe next station was carbo-junk food galore. Little baskets of sweet potato tater tots (please don't get me started), regular tator tots, fried chicken and french fries, don't remember the rest because I was too busy with the sweet potato tater tots. \n\nThis is also really random...but the grilled asparagus was delicious. I am a fighter when someone serves me asparagus but I willingly got up for a second serving of asparagus here.\n\nUnfortunately, the seafood station is another one that seems understaffed. I didn't try much of the seafood besides the crab because there were SO MANY PEOPLE! But, the crab was much too salty for my taste.\n\nBefore I end my praise of how great Bacchanal Buffet, PLEASE visit the crepe station and have one for me. In my visit, I ate 3, and its not because the crepes were small, unfortunately. I literally could not stop myself. There is an assortment of fresh blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and nutella, caramel, chocolate, freshly whipped whipped cream, etc. This crepe station alone is what sets Bacchanal aside from the others. \n\nHowever, there were a lot of things I was flat out not impressed with: \n1. The pathetic fruit selection. Not only was the selection pathetic but the presentation was not up to par with the other things in the buffet. Simple things like the pineapple...they didn't even remove the rind. My school dining hall serves the pineapple with rind. An upscale buffet where people are paying $45+tax and tip for dinner shouldn't have to do more work with the simple PINEAPPLE. Ok, enough with that. Onto the next thing\n2. The Mexican station...I thought this station could use some improvement. First of all, the shredded beef or whatever meat they served definitely has way too many chunks of fat in it. That is all. The tamales, tasty but not enough meat. \n3. I understand that everyone is adapting to the \"small plates\" trend but I am not a fan..some of the items like the curly fries or other fried items I wanted to try ONE of but since they were pre-portioned, I couldn't! Sometimes the buffets end up wasting more through this method. Thats more of a suggestion than a complaint but whatever.\n4. This place didn't have macaroons on my visit. But there are pictures on Yelp saying that they have macaroons. They either need to have macaroons everyday or not at all. (angry emoji)\n5. Lastly, they need a bathroom inside the actual buffet. The bathroom is right outside where you pay but its inconvenient having to share a bathroom with everyone in the casino/hotel along with the buffet customers.\n\nOf course, no buffet is perfect so I'm afraid I have to give it a solid four stars. I hope to see continuous improvements on my next visit! (and hopefully not another price increase)\n\nPS. I didn't think the servers were as slow as people made them out to be. Within 2 minutes we had our initial greet with our server to take our drinks. By the time I brought back my first plate, the drinks were there. Just an FYI!","review_id":"k4LflWIpe5_S43INQYFK7A","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"7Q6nBHl6NJ9gbJ900FkkAg","date":"2012-12-04"},{"cool":1,"text":"Mediocre to say the least.

So we decided to try the place.  First of all, the buffet is located inside the Ceasar's Palace Hotel and Casino, not at the Forum. If you are driving to the hotel,  prepare to look for the closest valet as there are at least 4 or more valets at this hotel.  Once we got to the restaurant, there was a long line, as expected.  Since there were 7 of us, we were directed to another line  for parties of 6 or more. We didn't wait that long before we were finally seated.  I was not really impressed with the ambiance.  The space looked really cramped, the table we sat at wasn't steady and kept rocking, it was not what I had expected.  Once we were seated, we waited about 10-15 minutes before our drink order was taken.  The food was not as great as I expected it to be. They had an Asian buffet line which consisted of various dumplings and shumai, the usual noodles and fried rice along with spring rolls.  Variations of sushi and soup.  The usual BBQ and pizza line and of course , if you're craving for Mexican food, they have a variety of that as well.  If you're into seafood like I am, I went straight for  the crab legs and fresh oysters.  They we actually good size crab legs. The oysters  tasted fresh.  I think the best part of the buffet was their desert line. From cake pops to Creme Brûlée and ice cream to Asian sesame Mochi balls.  Our waitress, Milka, was very nice and even brought my daughter a birthday plate full of deserts. Overall,  the food was okay.  Not as spectacular as I thought it would be.  Dinner starts at 52.99 per person. So if you're a light eater, may as well eat someplace to get your money's worth.","review_id":"jCbyGN4qMCr0xgHnpOh1dQ","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"B2x3kEXXo8iUdtS9FhGO4A","date":"2016-02-16"},{"cool":1,"text":"Buffets are never a good option for me since I never eat enough and also don't really appreciate the \"expensive' items as much as others.\n\nThat said, I really enjoyed Bacchanal for a number of other reasons. They have a huge selection that varies from traditional Chinese Black Chicken Soup (with Ginseng) to little baskets of Fried Chicken and Fries.\n\nI personally really enjoyed the Bolognese (but I tend to love anything with Marinara/Meat Sauce). The dessert selection was pretty extensive but I found it odd that there was a 2-Mochi limit, when there was a free-for-all for the crab legs.\n\nThe overall quality of the food seemed pretty good to me and I really enjoyed the Spicy Poke (it is surprisingly spicy).\n\nOne thing I really wished they had more of was fruit, I know the typical buffet goer might not feel the same, but the limited selection of fruit was kind of sad.\n\nThe decor is super cute and my girls and I were lucky enough to get a semi-private room. The service was great and the waiters were kind enough to assist me with my bachelorette party scavenger hunt by suggesting a male escort.\n\nMake sure you get there early enough to avoid the lines! If you have a party of 10 or more they will charge you gratuity right off the bat.

She also never inquired about additional beverage services throughout the menu, after she took our first drink orders. Also there is a lackluster selection of seafood (disclaimer - what seafood was here was large and impressive, e.g. U-10 sized cocktail shrimp) offered. The clam chowder was fair, too sweet, and strangely thin for a chowder - regardless of how big the chunks of lobster were I was confused about this dish all the more.

I will reflect on all of the food that I tried and then also note what I ate that I know got me sick. \n\nFirst of all.. there are a lot of high quality dishes that Bacchanal offers. I do not think that they have anywhere near 500 items... Not sure how they got that number, maybe they counted every single section of sauce and the hot sauce bottles and each spoon for each individual sauce...\n\nhowever what they don't have which was advertised when they first open was Snow Crab or Stone Crab Claws. Friday they only had KING CRAB and KING CRAB only... I am not sure if this is a 'Friday Saturday\" only thing or if they have snow crab on other days but one thing that is readily apparent is that they do NOT have STONE CRAB anymore. \n(with Joe's Stone Crab in the Forum shops selling those things by the half dozen for as much as this buffets price I would have liked to see that they were included completely in this buffet as I think Stone Crab claws are extremely sweet and flavorful.) \n\nAlso they raised their prices for Friday/Saturday dinner buffet to 39.95. the hour and a half long wait in line stunk too... \n\nI started with the Asian section.... the big surprise there was the soup dumpling. this little thing exploded in your mouth and was fantastic.. on from there the crispy beef was pretty good and so were the egg rolls surprisingly. \n\nWhen I got to the sushi, everything looked pretty fresh so I took 1 piece per roll and a few lone pieces of salmon and tuna on rice.. when I began to eat these however, the tuna tasted way too fishy and the salmon didn't smell right so I did not consume the pieces of fish. \n\nI moved on and unfortunately I skipped the ramen noodle section so I can't report how good that was. \n\nI took some of the sliced deli meats and drizzled some of the infused honey on top of them, this was great! \n\nThe Italian meatball was good and so was the lasagna.\n\nI liked the taco section, the meats they use were really good and it's nice to have the taco warmed up right in front of you.\n\nThe slider burger was fantastic, I could have eaten 5 of them for a regular meal and would have been very happy with them.\n\nThe best part of the buffet I think was that nice slice of tomahawk rib eye that the very entertaining meat cutter guy threw me.. so flavorful and tasty.\n\nOn to the seafood section... the shrimp were very good huge large shrimp that had great flavor and were just great... the lobster corn chowder was very good.\n\nthe shucked oysters and mussels were very fresh and sweet and had no bad smell to them whatsoever... \n\nThe king crab legs that I got were very large however they were also very frozen, I literally bit into an ice cube of crab meat and that wasn't very pleasant.. I should have had them heat the crab legs up... so unless you like a crabcicle then please have them do that.\n\nThe desserts were awesome... no big surprise there..\n\nNow here's where things went wrong...... I grabbed an oyster shooter... it was a small cup filled with an oyster on the bottom, some hot sauce and tomato juice.. after I shot it a few minutes later I immediately had a terrible sensation in my stomach that stayed there for 6 hours... at that point I was in so much pain I figured that I had to do the old apple cider vinegar trick to take care of food poisoning and 12 hours later I started to feel much better... so please be careful of those things... not sure if it was one of those off chance things and I got lucky but it had something to do with the sauce they used or the oyster or something however it was extremely painful and I'm glad it's over with.","review_id":"3SLKCcb_yGTWu0mUCRrkhg","stars":1,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":7,"user_id":"-Ng6kNjzZee-hT-RZYg_Eg","date":"2012-10-01"},{"cool":6,"text":"I am writing this review as I take my fifth break from this buffet. My tummy is about to explode as I have been eating since noon. It is a little before 2pm and we are staying until the dinner transition at 3 when they finally serve the macarons for dinner. Here is my story. \n\nIt is Monday and there was practically no wait whatsoever. We planned on going to the buffet after all that clubbing and pool activities and this was pretty much out highlight/thing we looked forward to the most. I forgot that it is also cheaper on Mondays so yay we win. Lunch is around 35 after tax and if you come after 3pm, then you pay around 10 bucks more. The best thing to do is come around 1:30 to 2 so you pay for lunch but then you are there for the dinner goodies. Asian cheap thinking right there. If it is weekends, the wait in line can be close to an hour and is more expensive so be prepared. \n\nThey have a range of food from Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, Italian, seafood and hella meat. They will have the typical food you expect at buffets but I noticed there are not as many of those prepared dishes with multiple ingredients if that makes sense. These are the things I got and I really recommend\n\nOrange juice- fresh with pulp and no sour taste! Some of the best OJ I have had\nOmelet- comes with everything you can imagine like sausage, ham, mushrooms spinach\nCongee- tastes so good and has preserved egg! Chinese donut tooo\nRamen- comes with pork and even tonkatsu flavor\nPulled pork- in the Mexico section. So flavorful\nGuacamole- next to Mexico. So fresh and there are chunks of guac! \nSalmon- it's seared and I only got it cuz it's an expensive item\nTacos- they heat it fresh and are so the flavor\n\nLava cake and hot baked cookie combo- they come in two separate containers but cut a hole in that and mix that fresh cookie in. It is mind blowing. \nFudge filled chocolate chip cookie- nuff said\nPeanut butter filled dark chocolate chip cookie- my most favorite thing cuz I'm a Cookie Monster and I love PB. Nuff said\nGelato- so many flavors but I got caramel and strawberry cheesecake\nMacarons- available for dinner starting at 3\n\nOverall, buffets are good no matter what. It's also cheaper on weekdays for lunch so that coo. I was trying to do the lunch dinner transition for the Wynn buffet but they close down in between. I feel like there are not as many dishes at this place than The Buffet or Wicked Spoon. I like Wicked Spoon better cuz I feel like they have more savory plates and more desserts.

The bad thing about it, it's gets kinda messy with people being dirty, food isn't fresh, waiting in line to get into the buffet and overeating. Bachanal isn't a bad buffet but i think it's overpriced. They do have other items that other buffets might not have but charging almost 70 dollars not including tip is outrageous. With those prices I rather go to a nicer restaurant. Wait here is also ridiculous. I heard people wait 2-3 hours to eat here. They don't even have a caeser palace hotel guest line.

The plump shrimp was the best of the 3 but with the shrimp being straight on the ice it tasted soft and semi water logged. The roasted red pepper bisque was flavorless and tasted more like a tomato soup. The miso glazed cod was cooked well but was luke warm and the wasabi mashed potatoes accompanying it were also luke warm which made the outer layer hard. Next, I went to the italian station and got the meatballs which were nicely presented and the penne carbonara. The meatball tasted fine but the tomato sauce was overly sweet and made the entire dish taste artificial. The carbonara tasted nothing like a carbonara, pasta was overcooked and it reminded me of the quality of pasta I would have tasted from a Souplantation. A few more low points were the sashimi being warm; pretzel rolls being dry; corn chowder crusty on top from it being luke warm; brisket more fat than meat. The one positive thing I will say is that this buffet has solid and well done desserts. I had the carrot cake; beignet; churro; strawberry cheesecake ice cream; mint chip ice cream; cheesecake pop; chocolate ganache log; oreo chocolate mousse. Carrot cake was moist and cream cheese frosting on top was nicely done. Beignet was also nicely done with it being freshly fried and warm. Churro was tasty but was more soft than crispy. Chocolate ganache log was my favorite; you could tell the chocolate was of high quality. \n\nOverall, I was very disappointed in the quality and execution of the food especially the hot items. The only reason I am even giving Baccchanal 2 stars is for the thoughtful/tasty dessert items.","review_id":"_9xk1XPR2orP1IEalfkvGQ","stars":2,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":2,"user_id":"hulIBBzPsCaQDcoh_JgSBA","date":"2014-06-16"},{"cool":5,"text":"This buffet is overpriced. I have paid the same or maybe more to taste a way better buffet (at the Cosmo) and a slightly better one (at the Wynn). I really don't mind paying if it lives up to the quality, but everything here is a gimmick.\n\nFor starters service is ridiculously terrible. You know most places train their employees to move out of the way for guests when they're walking by, here you have to move for them? As if we should be lucky to taste tacos being served up by someone who probably just got released from a rehabilitation home or omelette's from a \"chef\" that messes one up, doesn't apologize and just cycles through another 5 minutes to give you it. \n\nIt's a large buffet. They have a lot of sections to chose from. I did sample sizes of I'd say 75% of the food and nothing stood out. Really..NOTHING. Things were either decent or a disappointment. I was sad, I usually use table time to talk about how great or good certain things are, I was silent. I had to check my location and make sure I wasn't inside of like the Southpoint Hotel or something of that level.\n\nAvoid this buffet. I don't see what's so great about it? If you want a specific thing I suggest to just find a restaurant that specializes in that in Vegas. If you want brunch find a romantic little spot that will give you a quality experience. And if you really want to go to a buffet, there's a great one at the Cosmopolitan.

A lot of what I've heard described in reviews was NOT on the buffet that we went to on a Tuesday at lunchtime.\n\n    That being said, we also paid half of what others pay at night.  We arrived around 10:45 a.m., so it was around $50 for both of us (before tip).\n\n   2)  TIP!  Add gratuity to that bill when you pay it at the register.  They will MARK your receipt as a tipper.  Don't know if that gives you extra credit or what, but they sure make note of it.  And if that's not reason enough, these servers work hard keeping your drinks refilled and whisking away endless empty plates.  They also take salt and pepper shakers very seriously, as I heard a serious conversation that involved keeping track of whose were whose. (you have to ask for it, if you want them, by the way, they aren't on the table).\n\n  3) PACE YOURSELF.  They were changing over from breakfast to lunch when we arrived, so they kept putting out new things.  Favorites for me were some Asian items...the eggplant, green beans, fried fish.  Also thought the sliders were excellent quality, onion rings very good.  There was an awesome truffled potato gratin, a tasty tater tot casserole...a very flavorful chicken habanero sausage (although there was nothing habanero hot about it).  From the Italian section, not a lot was calling out to me, but I did have a meatball which was good, although very big...a smaller one would have been even better.    Seafood was disappointing to me, as expectations were high based on the reviews I had read, but those were obviously for dinner.  I asked if it was too early for crab legs, and was told yes, not until after 3.  Steamed shrimp were good though.\n\n   4) Dessert selection must be different this early in the day, also.  VERY GOOD though, but sadly, no macaroons!  I tried a passion fruit meringue tart and a chocolate creme brulee.  Both were pretty good.\n\n   So, to sum up my personal Bacchanal experience, it was quite good, but being lunch-time buffet eaters,  we have preferred our lunch-time experiences at both  Wynn and Wicked Spoon.","review_id":"m4P-G6AywHFDdmINaRAGSQ","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":2,"user_id":"fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg","date":"2013-11-17"},{"cool":3,"text":"Ohhhhh LAWDY!

I am usually hit or miss with buffets, Im not super into gourmet foods so its like meh with me! \n\nThere are many different selections from this buffet and it's also in 2 different room if you weren't sitting in the back you would probably never noticed that there is a back area of the buffet as well. I followed 2 of the other people who are on our table and it brought me to the macaroni and cheese, prime rib, lamb chops, ribs, and chicken tenders with tater tots station. the way some of the food is served are in little metal  look basket things like fry baskets but they're really cute the only thing is you can only grab 1 or 2 at a time without having a full plate. the first place I got included lamb chops, which I have never tried, so I was really excited. I also got some chicken tenders with French fries and tater tots and a side of macaroni and cheese. I thought down to my plate of goodies and took a bite, the first thing I took a bite out of with macaroni and cheese and left me a little sad and needed seasoning for sure. It was pretty bland in my opinion. the second thing I tried with lamb chops, now I have never had lamb chops before so this is definitely a new experience for me and I was very pleased. the lamb chops to cook perfect in my opinion they were so so so succulent and tender and they were exquisitely seasoned very very very delicious! next I tried the chicken tenders tater tots and French fries. They were all seasoned soo deliciously it what a breath of fresh air. The chicken was also very succulent under which is also very nice because that shows that they were not some of those frozen chicken tenders that other places serve! \n\nthere was so many different things to try out I didn't really know what to pick. I definitely do not like seafood I do like shrimp but only need the coconut type which they did not have here. Although a lot of the things did look appetizing I just didn't try them mainly because I do not like seafood or the way it smells. here they had some crab legs which everybody was going for that shrimp mussels and other types of others seafood that I really wasn't sure what they were I did try though the grits with shrimp and it was okay. \n\nNext to me my way to the back area where they were serving dim sum and ramen, pho, and different types of meats and cheeses as well as Italian foods. here I got some ramen, which had pork belly in it, as well as some cheeses. next I want to Mexican food area where they had carne asada as well as homemade tortillas and big pieces of Mexican corn. I also really like the way they just played the different types ugh salsas although the jars should have had a bigger openings so that way it wouldn't be so difficult to maneuver the spoon to get a spoonful of salsa or guacamole. \nbetween a Mexican food and the American type food thank you have an array of different breads that you can choose from I did try some of the roles which word very delicious and they also had cheese bread and regular pieces of white bread as well as other types.\n\nOnce I got seated I did try out the different types of foods that God I did like the Ramen it was very delicious and wonderful! I also tried the mini burger sliders, these were so delicious and cooked perfectly! I bit into my big piece of corn and was very happy and pleased, I taste just like the kind you would get in Mexico with butter and cheese on it, very delicious! \n\nNext I ventured off to the desert area where they had a humongous array of different desserts you can do some gelato  bananas foster to different types of cupcakes as well as chocolate dipped cones most and other types of yummies! opted for the tiramisu as well as a souffle and a chocolate dipped cone which was super delish!  \n\noverall the buffet was very tasty and delicious I don't know if I would pay 40 dollars for dinner since I do not eat seafood and  really wasn't too too much that I would chose to eat, plus I'm really bad at some types of buffets because I'm so simple.

The price ($70) was the most expensive buffet in Vegas, but did include a special offering of Lobster and champagne to ring in the new year.  \n\nThe place was absolutely packed as expected on New Year's Eve but as time went by things slowed down and the food lines dropped off.  The lobster was split in half and you could only get one lobster per trip, but return for another each time you got back in line.  The lobster was on the smaller side, but very tasty.  The lamb shank was a bit tough.  They had diver scallops set atop risotto and was always hot, tender and delicious.\n\nTheir sushi offerings were very subpar and a big disappointment.  I am a big sushi and sashimi fan and the quality was very poor.  Stringy fish and  not fresh.  The sushi maker behind the counter was slower than molasses as I waited for him to put some fresh fish out.  After I tasted it I just tossed it aside and concentrated on other dishes.  They had plenty of prime rib and rib eye that was outstanding.  They also had Kobe sliders that were flavorful, but cold.  Best to ask for a fresh, hot slider made to order rather than grabbing one for the heat lamp.\n\nThe  waited that took care of us was outstanding and the bus help was excellent as well, considering how busy this place was.  \n\nThe macaroons were so amazing and flavorful.  My favorites were the blueberry and the chocolate.  Very fresh and tasty.  The gelato and ice cream was very creamy and delicious.  Many different flavors that you won't find in other buffets.

My stomach only has space for ONE buffet while I'm visiting Vegas. Forget that 24 hour buffet pass. You'll find me passed out in the middle of the buffet tray if I ever tried doing that. \n\nThe Wicked Spoon used to be my #1 stop, but then I heard Ceasar's Palace had the next great thing. I had to check out it out!\n\nAnd then there was the line........... O_O\n\nJust when you thought the line was over, there was another line. The hubby and I waited an hour and a half until we were seated. According to the employees there, that wait time was SHORT. Over two hours is the norm.\n\nThe buffet is normally about $40/person with lunch being cheaper, but because we were there during Thanksgiving, they had a \"holiday price\" of $55/person. Bah humbug. \n\nOnce we got inside, we were just OVERWHELMED. Sooooo much food. Soooo many people! There was every kind of Asian cuisine, Italian, Mexican, American... eeeeeeverything. \n\nThe most popular (and longest!) line was the line for the king crab legs. You can have them cold or have them warmed up by the staff. They'll give you a good amount at a time, but you know one visit just isn't enough! I can feel my cholesterol rising... The crab is fresh and tender. Definitely get them warm instead of cold!\n\nThe freshly sliced prime rib is awesome! You can tell them what temperature you want and they'll try their best to find the slice closest to it. You can even ask for one of the prime rib bones if you dare to man handle it!\n\nIf you love foie gras, try the foie gras soup! Totally droooolworthy!\n\nDon't forget to check out the made-to-order noodle soup station! You can get beef pho, wonton soup or ramen. The ramen was my fave! I thought it was going to taste like some fancy packaged ramen, but it tasted really close to authentic Japanese ramen. The pork was so tender.\n\nWhen it came to dessert, I was suuuuuper stuffed. But I had to try a bite of everything they had to offer. The Jean Phillippe macrons they had were amazing. I kept going for more and more and more. I even slipped some in my bag to take home. SHHH!\n\nBut the most amazing, most fabulous, jaw-dropping dessert they had was their FLAN. Who doesn't love flan? It was so creamy, so flavorful, SO FREAKING GOOD! Even though I was beyoooond full, I ate more than two of them. Not too sweet. Just the right soft, yet slightly dense, texture. I could eat it all day long!\n\nThis is definitely a top contender for buffets. I didn't think they could surpass The Wicked Spoon, but they did and then some! Definitely worth checking out! Just bring a snack with you while you're waiting in the two hour line to get in. The price and wait time almost makes it not worth it, but if you only have money/time for one buffet, make it this one!!","review_id":"WctOe66JvddxPVV_kAlp6A","stars":5,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":7,"useful":10,"user_id":"WB-ivH1N3Jew0oFs98NqYQ","date":"2013-02-27"},{"cool":1,"text":"All of the food selections are delicious, especially considering that this is a buffet. \n\nThe reason I give this buffet 3 stars is that no particular item really stood out to me.

Good thing we planned ahead and got Fat Tuesdays for the wait.\n\nOnce we were at the front of the line, paying and getting seated were pretty quick.

It's gourmet in a buffet form, and neatly portion-controlled with these nice presentations.  \n\nThere's a carvery station, a variety of ethnic food, and a seafood area.  But what really sets Bacchanal apart is the foods that are freshly prepped!  I'm a huge fan of the noodle bar, where you can get tonkatsu ramen or pho.  I got the ramen twice because it was pretty damn legit :P  At the taco station, you can ask them to make tacos and quesedillas with the protein of your choice.  The pasta station has pastas made-to-order, as well as ready made ones.  For the seafood section, they can steam/boil the crab for you so it is perfect for people like me that likes their crab legs on the warmer side.\n\nHuge huge fan of the Asian section as well.  There's xiao long bao and a variety of dim sum items.  I didn't think it would be good but I was really surprised, especially with the xiao long bao!  \n\nFresh squeezed juices laid out for the taking.  Much needed after a long night of partying haha.\n\nDessert section was huge as well, in an area by itself.  Crepes, ice cream, cakes, pies, cookies, pastries... plenty to choose from.  Creme bruelee!\n\nThe only thing that was disappointing was the carvery station.  The prime rib was bland, and the other items were extremely tough.  There is a lot to choose from, but you can tell some of them have been sitting under the heat lamp for a bit too long, like the brisket.  The line can get ridiculous for that as well.\n\nWe were lucky and only waited 15 minutes in line for Sunday brunch.  I've heard stories from friends how they have waited 2-3+ hours for the buffet.  Also, if you have a Total Rewards card, use it, since you get a bit of a discount.\n\nService is a bit spotty.  Our guy was so busy and had to shuffle between taking drink orders and taking away the dirty dishes.\n\nCompared to the other top buffets, it might not beat Wynn in terms of taste or quality but I think the way they have it set up, especially with food prepped right in front of you, and the variety makes it the best buffet in Vegas.

You'll have to ask for help in getting the hot legs.  Oysters were fresh, sautéed clams were good, while Crawfish lacked spiciness of a good Cajun Crawfish boil.  Poke had too many non-fish ingredients and not much in fish.  In the past, Poke was distributed in small metal cups and was tastier with more fish.

So, if I'm going to do some damage at a buffet, I might as well do it right!\n\nLike so many of the better (and pricier) buffets in Vegas, Bacchanal does a great job of combining both quality (for a buffet) and variety in their offerings.  Seriously, there's PLENTY to choose from - seafood (crab legs, raw oysters, mussels, shrimp, etc.), sushi, salad, pizza, pastas, made-to-order tacos, carvery station (lamb, prime rib, sausages, pork loin, etc.), Asian dishes, fruits, desserts (chocolate covered strawberries!), and more.  \n\n-- PLATE #1 - Prime Rib, Sausage, lamb, Onion Rings\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#mrb056oZjB9C2jzPM-2sYQ)\nThe guy gave me a cut matching the wellness I wanted, but also with lot of tendons.  Still, the meat was tender and well-seasoned.  The lamb was great as well (perhaps a tad salty) and the sausage was fine, though nothing special.\n\n-- PLATE #2 - Raw Oysters, Fresh Snow Crab Legs, Salmon Sashimi, Tempura Roll\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#IK9Vz3U6qMf6W1-Yi22rNA)\nFor the most part, Bacchanal's seafood is fresh.  The oysters were plump and meaty (though not as sweet as smaller varieties) and the crab was terrific (too bad no king crab...).  Also, while the tempura roll was rather \"meh\", the salmon sashimi was pretty good.\n\n-- PLATE #3 - Carne Asada Taco, Carnitas Taco, and Chips with Salsa and Guacamole\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#ITbZBYTJhTZ8GClrU4nLHg)\nI had hopes for the tacos since they were cooked to order, but they were just okay.  The taste was fine, but both the carne asada and carnitas were dry and tough.  Not surprising given how small the meat was cut though.\n\n-- PLATE #4 - Lobster Chowder and Kobe Beef Slider\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#J0kJKgJhIn2HdzgdVPaWOQ)\nThe chowder was a little salty, but the consistency was spot on.  Impressive for a buffet, though I wish there was more lobster.  The sliders though were easily the worst thing I had.  Sitting under the warmers grossly overcooked the beef.\n\nTo deal with the steady crowd that flows in every night, Bacchanal has a pretty good system set-up.  Instead of the usual snaking lines, they have kiosks where you can enter your name, party size, and cell phone number.  After the machine prints out your ticket, you're free to leave until they text you to let you know you're next.  Otherwise, you can pay an extra $15 per person for the \"express\" option.\n\nWhile the \"express\" option is nice, it's also a gamble.  The kiosk quoted a 45-55 minute wait for the two of us, which seemed high since it was quiet on a Thursday night at 8pm.  Still, we declined since we weren't that hungry anyways.  No more than about 5-10 minutes later though, we got a text telling us we were up.  Risky, to say the least.\n\nAlthough I can't say for myself, I've heard from friends that Wicked Spoon has fallen off a bit as of late.  Between that and how the vast majority of what we had was pretty solid (save for the sliders, but much better overall than Bellagio), Bacchanal just might be my new favorite buffet in Vegas.  Even if it might be by default.","review_id":"MJ-Me8BhArnR5bzXHTGjgg","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":15,"useful":18,"user_id":"JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA","date":"2014-04-23"},{"cool":0,"text":"I going to give this place 3 stars.

It used to be Wynn and bellagio but this buffet is a game changer. Fresh, quality ingredients. Diverse selections. Creative dishes. Gluttony at its best. I don't remember how many times I've been here but it seems like it's almost tradition every time I'm in vegas. I do like that they changed the waiting system. Instead of making you stand in a 2 hour line, they give you a ticket and tell you to come back around a certain time.  Is it cheap? Definitely not. But the food is completely worth every penny. The staff here is always very nice and accommodating. Impeccable cleanliness.

However, I'm only giving it 3 stars cuz well alot of the dishes weren't really all that great tasting.  The presentation is beautiful and the service top notch but several of the dishes I tried were either overcooked or rather bland, especially the \"American\" dishes.\n\nThe best section was by far the Asian dishes -- these were all standouts IMHO including the dim sum and the noodle dishes. The dessert bar was also good but a few of the desserts I tried were just kinda meh. The gelato on the other hand was outta this world --- a definite MUST try. \n\nJust as a point of reference.. we went at 1:30 and there was NO line. When we came out the line was crazy long so it seems like this a good time to come if you want to avoid the crazy crowds.","review_id":"_ZylJCombUqgZE8OpkorRg","stars":3,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":2,"user_id":"WvntDWMQnaEV8agu3gcTug","date":"2013-05-18"},{"cool":0,"text":"VERY good they have so much selection of food\ni mean the quality isnt the best but they do have a lot of differnet types of food in a nice \n \niv been here twice and rememebr i had to be taken to my hotel room via forklift...its NUTS i ate the whole place it was delicious! \n\nonly knock ont his place is the CCCCCCCCRAZY PRICE but could be worth it. watch out for the line! can be super long. they also have a cheasy fast pass line where you pay extra...oh vegas....so dirty","review_id":"H696u8HlCawMVF_oktZSow","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":1,"useful":1,"user_id":"OrzYy9Z16vA7B-jSLjit7Q","date":"2014-03-04"},{"cool":2,"text":"I feel like buffets go through cycles when certain ones are better than others...for me it was Bellagio 10 years ago, then it was Wicked Spoon a few years ago...when I looked to see what would be the best, this came up and I'm so glad I went - wow, incredible buffet!\n\nI'm not going to write all the different items since there are just so many, but they have many, many options.

It is also the most expensive buffet. \n\nLocated inside the Caesars Casino and Hotel. This buffet costs $52 per person for the buffet buffet. $52 for hundreds of dishes to try. \n\nThe food includes a seafood station, classic American food station, craving station, Mexican station, Italian station, salad station, Japanese station, Chinese station, and a dessert station. \nThe food are really good here. This buffet takes more time in making sure the food is on point and are presented nicely organized.\n\nI recommend eating some crab legs and shrimp cocktails. They were quite delicious. I would also try the udon and ramen noodle soups because they were very tasty and the soup stocks are good. \n\nBeing that I'm Chinese, I was quite surprised that the Chinese food were decent here. They had dim sum and it was good. I kept going back for the congee. \n\nUnlimited drinks here, but you should really go for the guava juice in the Mexican station. Really good juice. \n\nThe only downside about this place is the wait. Depending on how many people you have, it could be a wait. \n\nThe restaurant has a really nice ambience and it's a good place to eat. If you don't mind the wait and price. It is rated one of the top buffets.","review_id":"PQ8LdwyG1_LJAPF6thVNTw","stars":4,"business_id":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","funny":0,"useful":3,"user_id":"lmJy4OwP_TyHIg8a8Q0RsA","date":"2015-08-09"}],"ProductID":"RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g"}
