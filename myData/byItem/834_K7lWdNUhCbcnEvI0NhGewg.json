Well...I don't know if you deserve to have that title as of yet. First off the d√©cor, I'm a big fan. The orange-ish (I know not a word)/yellow hues and the brown give it a modern restaurant feel, it doesn't feel like you're inside of a cheesy buffet. The tables are set up in ways similar to some restaurants in town and they actually give you water in a bottle (whether its really tap or not) instead of just slamming a glass of water on the table and having to refill it with the old school yellowish clear water pitcher that's been used 7,498 times and probably not washed, very refreshing. Not to mention the service was pretty good. Everyone that worked there was quick and attentive so I like that as well.\n\nSecond, this may not mean anything to anyone but they have a bathroom inside the buffet. I find that to be huge. It's not vital but listen the last thing I wanna do after I've been cracking crab or eating something else with my hands is dig in my pocket for my receipt, walk out of the buffet in the casino to the nearest bathroom, and then come back just to stand near the exit and convince the people there that I was already in there and just had to use the bathroom. Is it really that big of a deal? No, but as with other things if it requires less effort on my part, then I'm all for it.\n\nFinally is the food which I'll have to split into two parts: the quality and the setup. The food quality kind of disappoints. The food selection is alright, the side dishes were okay, and all the meats I tried at the carving station were chewy and tough.  The fruit and  vegetable section was impressive but the overall quality of food was less than stellar. It was not as good as the buffet dinners at the M or the Bellagio. Maybe it was an off night because I keep hearing nothing but good things about the dinner and the brunch but I just felt very dissatisfied by the food quality. \n\n The setup is different, I like it but I don't. I would say that a good part of the buffet has dishes that come in tapas style or small single servings in these little mini pot like things. So lets say you want soup, it already comes in a mini pot with a handle. You want shrimp cocktail there's two small ones in a bowl with cocktail sauce at the bottom and a small lemon. This is a good idea in theory and saves the company money. It's a good idea if you just like to graze and taste and you're not exactly sure what you want, it gives you a little taste of everything. It also saves the company money from people like my friend greedy Nick who piles on 17 shrimp and a glob of cocktail sauce knowing damn well all he's going to eat is four shrimp. \n\nHowever, for people like me I usually know what I like and sometimes I like to go to just one item and eat all of that. Well that's kind of difficult to do with these small little bowls and pots. You could try to load them all on your plate but you'll maybe get about 5 small bowls without having to do a juggling act. You might think, well that's not too bad, but it just gets annoying. What if I feel like just eating shrimp or crab claws in those little pots. It's like finding a certain chip you like and only being allowed to put five on your plate and having to get up and walk back to the kitchen and go to the bag for five more chips. I know my inner fat kid is coming out. So you may be wondering is it really that big of a deal? Not really, but I get my exercise else where and then after I'm lazy ...just let me get a bigger serving so I can save the exercise for later.","review_id":"2IFl8dme5If8Re7LgDajKw","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":2,"useful":2,"user_id":"09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA","date":"2011-05-03"},{"cool":1,"text":"At $45 per person for dinner, I really can't recommend this buffet as a good value anymore.

But what comes to mind when thinking about what it is that differentiates this buffet mainly from the rest is portion control...\n\nNearly all of the items of the AYCE buffet are individually served in small cups, dishes, bowls, and even miniature saucier pans.  The effort is worth it since it results in a tidier, neater appearance throughout the serving area,  one can say that it's even a bit minimalist chic.  Items such as the Braised Short Rib http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=Pt101ZxBy4xxJZ9vyLFWeQ and the Creamed Corn http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=I_4S14ETI6Ahy4lOpz7WKQ are somehow more appealing than usual, and there is also the added benefit that flavors don't run together on your plate.  There is also a bit more civility and efficiency when reaching for an item as well...\n\nWhat would an AYCE be without the obligatory carving station.  At WS the prime rib is delectable,http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=U3-hRhqxkXSE0z-UN9dY2Q perfectly medium rare pink in the middle, and sliced to order,  I usually have my eye on the outside or end cut for greater seasoning taste.  On this occasion, they were also offering Roast Leg of Lamb http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=5fP1-uJVh49d-LELABqR0A,  however I found it to be particularly dry, especially since I got one of the first slices that are typically sliced parallel and away from the bone.  The perpendicular slices closer to the bone are more moist, even gamier, perhaps too much for some, but I like it.  Also in the category of not everyone's cup of tea is the beefy Bone Marrow http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=Db6R_AfMgkEU1SFlvsX1cQ located in front of the carving station.  The way to eat it is to spread the marrow like jam onto the nearby slices of bruschetta toast,  without which it would pretty much just taste like solid fat...\n\nFrom among all the seafood choices, I went for:\n\n- Mussels with fennel, onions, and pancetta;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=tN4AWvccv0dynEl7oS5hOA\n- Blackened Haddock with crawfish hollendaise;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=XATYdWxx7PaALBbF8PL3gQ\n- Shrimp cocktail;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=A0B0-WaLPZ92kIIN1SNHKg\n- Ceviche;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=K416rA7f9g9RypgA3fsLIQ\n\nI could have eaten a ton of the Mussels and the giant sized Shrimp and I did.  The Haddock was nicely breaded and fork flaky, but a little bit too heavy and chunky, I would expect this like most fish to be best when served straight out of the oven or from the pan, but instead it was probably sitting for awhile.  The ceviche was ok but lacked any pop or wow factor, and like the haddock is best when super fresh...\n\nOf all the salads to choose from, my strategy was to be severely limiting because I would rather not get filled up on salad at a place like this.  So my personal choice of the evening was the Thai Mango Salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=g9LLM5vZ1z84RaZmR_cftA, which was had all the requisite flavors and textures that I was looking for --  the cold noodle was vinegary but tangy and paired with the mango beautifully.  Edamame was added for opposing texture and crunch.  Also offered near the salad bar was a very interesting cold Watermelon Gazpacho soup served in a plastic cup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=UyPfzd6XRp1uGl_mcyBbpA -- fruity, a bit thick, but refreshing...\n\nThe seating near the dessert end of the dining room is nicer in my opinion than the other end which is near the restrooms.  Even so, I ate so much that I didn't make too much of effort with the desserts, although I gave it a half-hearted try...\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=lIM091QSTUnLU996py2InQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=1jdpyTOq1yqRHXrFHaKWwg\n\nSince it is in the vicinity of the Marquee, you will get some clubbers coming here before they go into the club, especially on a Saturday night;  not an issue, just an observation.  At $35 per person, this is going to be one of your more pricey buffet options, but I would still come back for more.  Some of the item seem to change from time to time to keep it interesting as well...","review_id":"03Wd3jTJ_LAKFId5hfFJPw","stars":5,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":2,"useful":4,"user_id":"LP59kBNEHmASJZWynra29g","date":"2011-10-28"},{"cool":27,"text":"Wicked Spoon was at the top of my list of places to go in vegas and i actually got a little depressed at the end of the meal when i didn't feel that 5 star feeling...

Located in the West Tower with ornate chandeliers, ample glass, and plenty of shine it would be easy to say that Wicked Spoon is the 'nicest' buffet in which I have dined but with expansive size as well as selection - over 150 items offered at $38 for brunch - it would be equally fair to suggest the immaculately clean space also represents one of The Strip's biggest \"bangs for the buck\" as a team of chefs spread across several open kitchens work diligently replenishing each station with ornate small plates at a speed that would put all but the most seasoned short-order cook to shame.  Expeditious and friendly in service with purified water on the table and good coffee refilled nearly every time a plate was cleared it was with a focus on variety that I explored the various stations of Wicked Spoon and although not every dish was a success I'd say 85% of the sixty-six items I sampled were at least good while a few far exceeded expectations.  Starting sweet then veering savory and subsequently switching back-and-forth as new plates emerged from the kitchen items such as the fresh fruit pastries immediately showed the strength of the pastry department and while chocolate options proved a touch heavy handed the gelato selection was stunning, the 'white chocolate coffee' and pistachio both on par with Art of Flavors in terms of texture and nuance.  Moving past disappointing Italian and Asian fare aside from swoon-inducing sweet polenta, well accompanied congee, and caramelized pork belly as well as duck it was on to more brunch-oriented offerings that I turned and while both the benedict and slab bacon shined the macaroni and chicken were merely decent - clever titles aside.  Largely skipping salads aside from the impressive beets but impressed by fruits, cheese, cereals, and charcuterie it was finally at the three-hour mark that I'd finally filled up and having already once sampled the delightful custard soaked Pullman it was to creativity I turned; two slices of the buttery cinnamon bread buried beneath a mountain of house-whipped Chantilly cream, Maple Syrup, Dates, and Granola far outperforming any 'designer' French Toast you'd pay $15 for elsewhere in the city.  \n\nUnable to compare Wicked Spoon to other Vegas buffets given my relative inexperience with the genre I can only say I was stunned by not only the quality of the food but the passion behind the project.  In a world of \"China Buffets\" and Golden Corral's where neither presentation nor preparation seems to matter, let alone freshness or sourcing, Wicked Spoon chooses to function like a proper small-plates restaurant with sparkling cleanliness to compliment a trained Chef's vision.","review_id":"cQYWXAubkbcvNU4QeW1SNQ","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":3,"useful":10,"user_id":"U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA","date":"2014-05-19"},{"cool":1,"text":"Wicked Spoon is the Cosmo's buffet on the Strip. It was $25 for lunch. Their selections were pretty standard with the salad, carving, brunch and omelette station, asian, italian, and dessert.  The setting is pretty cool with a black and orange color scheme. So, let's talk about the food.The only items that were memorable was the grilled house cured bacon, congee, and bone marrow. The fried chicken were seasoned with curry powder which tasted weird to me. The pork fried rice was bland and the shrimp \"takoyaki-esque\" balls were undercooked. They got some unique foods like a goat cheese and lavender panna cotta and a watermelon slice marinated in sriacha and lime. I thought most of the food here was pretty rich tasting (i.e. garlic bread, mushrooms gratin, eggs benedict). Even their salads were pretty overdressed that the salad was shining with olive oil. I will say this though...This buffet wins on presentation. The chicken were served in small fry baskets and the fried rice was in a chinese take-away box. I would probably give this place another chance and try go for dinner to see if its better. Oh btw, DO NOT eat the gnocchi here.

Having paid half price with a friend and a coupon,  I am still disappointed but much less so. \n\nSome of the food here I rather liked.  There was a stroganoff dish that was rich and creamy with the goat cheese in it.  And being loaded with mushrooms is never a bad thing.  Maybe it was on the salty side but other than that, it was pretty good.  There was a vanilla infused beet salad that was almost like a dessert.  I do like a good beet salad so this was a treat.  There was some Thai green curry that had some good flavor going on.  Coconut up front.  Curry spice on the back.  I just wish there was more beef.  I think my favorite from the serving line was a little smoked sausage with a nice snap.\n\nMy main complaint here is the freshness of the food.  Some of what I tried was really quite dried out.  The gnocchi with bolognese had almost no sauce left having been sucked up by the gnocchi which were then dried.  The shephards pies were mostly all burnt on top.  I had to look for one that at least still looked like mashed potatoes on top.  There was an Asian chicken dish that seemed moist but had so much skin and fat that after I pushed it aside I was left with little actual meat.  I did not care for the bone marrow.  That is more of a personal taste thing than it is a knock against this establishment.  I had never had marrow and was not expecting the gelatinous nature of it.  At least I tried it.  For people who are into that sort of food, they serve it here.  Enjoy.\n\nDessert looked great.  And for the most part it was all pretty good.  But again it seemed like it all was sitting out a while.  The mouse cakes were spongy and chewey. So was the banana macaron.  The chocolate covered strawberry was under ripe but still good.  My favorite dessert of the night was a pistachio cream eclair.  That was an interesting little take on one of my favorite of any desserts.  I only wish it was bigger that my little finger.\n\nUnfortunately I was not able to sample all the food here.  I have a shell fish allergy and shell fish happens to make up a large percentage of the offerings at Wicked Spoon.  The crab legs looked average and smelled fresh.  I hear the shrimp balls were good and my eyes would back that up.\n\nI am not used to this type of high end dining on the Strip.  I am more of a \"support your local Station Casinos\" kind of guy.  The small plates at Wicked Spoon that then receive smaller plates with yet smaller food is a turn off.  With some fancy foot work and putting my old Tetris skills to work I was able to fit maybe four or five foods on my plate at a time.  I prefer where I can just dump a spoon of this and a spoon of that and have half the offerings in one go.  Trying to place plates on plates just seems a waste of dishes.  Job security for the folks in the back I guess. And then there are the wine bottles, water bottles and drink menus on each small table making for little space to put all of your plates once you are done with them.  There is even less space when the bussing staff does not remove your used dishes by the time you get back with your next round of stacked servings.  I like the idea Wicked Spoon is going for here.  But at nearly $40 per person, I would like to see the execution improve.","review_id":"uRECIEgnmtFx5fMV7lQZrA","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":3,"useful":3,"user_id":"eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw","date":"2015-03-18"},{"cool":1,"text":"Wicked Spoon Buffet is located in the back of the Cosmopolitan.

They were able to accommodate us in various smaller tables. We had the brunch which was around $30 a person before tax. Since we had such a large group, they kindly included the gratuity. We noticed that some of the other tables had unlimited mimosas. If you want the unlimited mimosas, it will cost you an additional $9.\n\nI love the presentation of the food here.

The angry mac n cheese they had was good, and so were their mashed potatoes. The roast beef was slightly dry and no one at my table was a big fan of the bone marrow, although I liked it.

This thing was more flavorful than your grocery store kind.\n- Korean BBQ Short Ribs. Tasted just like Korean BBQ in LA, I could eat this forever.\n- BEST GELATO IN LAS VEGAS, I had to try 3 flavors, the nutella, raspberry, and stracciatella! stracciatella was definitely really good and worth a try. I also loved the raspberry cause it was tart and sour, just the way I like it! Next time, I'm trying ALL the flavors.\n- Ceviche was very fresh and good also. \n- There was a chilled bottle of champagne over ice on our table, and we did not touch it because of our endless mimosas. However, the waitress gave us to go cups so we could drink it walking back to our hotel :)\n\nNegatives\n- Price, paid $41 for brunch, and I'd say that it wasn't worth it, comparing to other Vegas buffets. You definitely pay more for presentation of food and because it's the Cosmo, than the quality or taste of the food.\n- Lunch closes at 3:30 and dinner starts at 5:30 I believe, so you can't stay for lunch and then get the dinner price, unless you just sat around for 2 extra hours doing nothing.\n- NO CRAB LEGS :'(\n- NO CREME BRULEE :'(\n- Only 1 flavor of macarons, orange. :/ \n- Cakes that taste like any other cake at a Vegas buffet.\n- Average selection of Asian dishes you can get from Panda Express. It was incredibly disappointing, I was hoping for more. They offered steamed white rice...really? \n- Shrimp did not taste fresh\n- Salmon over salted\n- Chocolate cake was super super sweet\n- Ordered the Bottomless Mimosas for $9 extra. Waitress brought us 3 mimosas at a time, which I didn't like because while you're drinking your 1 mimosa, the other 2 were not cold. Either she wanted us really drunk, or she was too lazy to keep checking in on our table. And she was very non-existent the entire time. \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a huge buffet person. Everything tastes the same to me no matter what buffet it is. They always have something good, something bad, and something average. Wicked Spoon isn't that much different from other Vegas buffets. I'll save my 5 star buffet rating when everything I eat is amazing. \n\nI would go to Wicked Spoon again, but I don't NEED to go.

Mini fryer baskets with fried chicken, mini take out Chinese containers with noodles or fried rice, cast iron skillets with mac and cheese, a risotto offering in a small cassoulet dish and the list goes on. \n\nThe dessert area was one like I have never seen including a full gelato station with several flavors offered. The husband imbibed in the dessert offerings quite a bit but sadly, I was too full. \n\nSince we were in Vegas celebrating our 5th Anniversary, it didn't dawn on me that we would be in town for Chinese New Year AND the Super Bowl.

Let me start by saying it has been awhile since I've been here so I did go with a lot higher expectations. From what I remembered I use to think this buffet was huge and had tons of food options. I also remember it standing out because of its presentation of single serving foods. The rarity of some certain entrees and wide selection of cuisines. \n\nToday however I was a bit taken back by the lack of choices and abundance of \"typical\" entrees. Nothing, I repeat nothing stood out. You wait in line for 40 min to pay, only to stand in another line for 15 min to be seated...all for what I can only say is an average buffet.   Sad to sat but I should have suggested to go to bachannal. I wonder how well they would do if they weren't inside the Cosmopolitan. \n\nAnyways, service was also below par.

Hip and trendy, this is located inside the very chic Cosmopolitan Hotel. \n\nI've frequented this buffet quite a handful of times now so my review here is long overdue. My last visit was over Thanksgiving and it was only by default that we came because our original plan was to hit up Bacchanal Buffet (the new and very hyped up buffet at the Caesars Palace) which had a ridiculous wait of 3-4 hours at 2PM. Sorry, I'm not THAT crazy to stay in line that long. Wicked Spoon here we come! Ohhhh yeah!!\n\n45 minutes of waiting in line to pay and another 45 minutes to get seated, not bad! We paid about $50 per person for dinner as opposed to $60 in Bacchanal for their Thanksgiving rate. You have to pay extra $$ if you want mimosa included. \n\nSo among the plethora of food choices to choose from, arranged by cuisines from all corners of the world, below is an outline of the reasons why I love Wicked Spoon. \n\nFOR STARTERS, I WENT CRAZY OVER THESE:\n-Pumpkin Soup---Not sure what else is in this soup aside from the pumpkin but it's hearty and addicting! \n-King Crab Legs---Fresh and sweet! \n-Shrimp Cocktail---Succulent! \n\nFROM THE CARVING STATION:\n-Bone Marrow---I ate this like there was no tomorrow. I probably need to see a heart doctor soon but it was all worth it. \"A moment on your lips, a lifetime on the hips!\" \n-Roast Beef---Yummm...\n-Lamb---Cooked perfectly, not gamey, tender, juicy, tasty...Need I say more!?\n-Turkey---Not a turkey fan but it was Thanksgiving so I had to eat some. It was great! \n\nSEAFOOD ENTREES:\n-Shrimps---Cooked in butter, garlic, and other spices. I got down and dirty eating these crustaceans. Delicious!\n-Mussels Mariniere---I had 3 bowls of these. The sauce was fantastic! I was literally slurping it down. \n\nASIAN CORNER:\n-Roasted Pork Belly---5-spice infused, the pork was beautifully cooked. It was juicy, tender, and flavorful! The crispy skin was a nice added touch. \n\nCARBO LOADING:\n-Paella\n-Mushroom Risotto\n-Mac N Cheese---Dude!! They have a MADE-TO-ORDER STATION for this! It's amazing! You get to pick what you want in your Mac N Cheese. Sooooo goooood!\n\nDESSERT:\n-Chocolate Covered Strawberries---This is one sight to behold and an indulgence to partake. A must!\n-Gelato---A myriad of flavors to choose from...you'll go crazy! Thai Iced Tea and Nutella were my top two favorites! \n-Macarons---Last but not the least, these are not to be missed. They had the mango flavored that day and it was divine! Sad to say, the next batch didn't have the same perfect consistency as the first ones I've had. All's well though because I may have had as much as my heart's content before the 2nd batch came out.   \n\nSERVING:\nMost of their dishes are already pre-plated in small portions. It's nice how they do this because not only does it minimize waste, it also allows you to try small portions of all the food selections they have to offer without over filling yourself. I like their concept: unique and practical! \n\nSERVICE:\n-From the people at the register, to the receptionist, and to the server, everyone were all smiles and efficient in what they do. Our plates were cleared whenever needed and our drinks were always filled. Top-notch service! \n\nFor now, I think Wicked Spoon is the best buffet in Vegas. Quality food and service. Then again, I have yet to try what Bacchanal has to offer.

That is what Vegas is for right?  What if you already are in Vegas.  Where do you go to be bad?  Well, Cosmopolitan of course. As they say, they have the right amount of \"bad\".  I don't really know what the right amount of bad is, but if it's anything like Wicked Spoon, they got it right.  I've been to my share of Las Vegas buffets -- Wicked Spoon just raises the bar.\n\nI was first impressed with their carving station.  They had bone marrow! I took two.  Shhhhh.  Eating those things with some horseradish and chimichurri, smeared on a crostini.  It was great.  Rich in fat, and delicious.\n\nI was lucky enough to grab the freshest crab legs they had, straight out of the steamer.  Conveniently next to the carving station, they poured mounds of crab legs all for me. Great timing Franklin.\n\nI made my way to the mac and cheese bar.  How awesome is it that I got to have my mac and cheese however I liked.  I had them put some bacon and jalapenos.  Of course, I had to have blue cheese and parmasan. They prepare it all right in front of you and it comes out bubbling hot.  It tasted so delicious.  The blue cheese was strong, which I liked and the jalapenos gave it a nice spiciness -- the bacon just topped it all off.  All in my personal copper pot.  Perfect.\n\nMy favorite food item that was not at a station was definitely the polenta.  It was really creamy and fulfilling.  It tasted kind of like grits -- less of a bite, yet more firm.  It was cheesy and delicious. I also liked the fried chicken wings and duck.  I tried some pretty good Peking duck in SGV, and theirs was amazingly close to good duck.  Impressive.\n\nI was kind of disappointed with their dessert options.  This was all because of my assumptions in my head.  I had a misconception about Wicked Spoon -- I always thought it was a dessert only buffet. So when I thought this through, I thought to myself \"This place must be a dessert sugar rush paradise.\"  Though their desserts weren't what I imaged it would be, it still was a good experience.  I didn't really have a favorite one like I did at The Buffet at the Wynn, but it was all a great ending to my massive meal.\n\nBuffets are almost all the same at Vegas.  Meat station, crab legs, and other food items.  Wicked Spoon impressed me.  Not only was most of the food good, but they offer cuisine that is not common in all buffets.  Bone marrow, Peking duck, gourmet cheese bar, I can go on and on.  I did see a less of a sushi/sashimi menu -- I guess it is a small price to pay. Though I do like sushi, it was well worth it.  It was refreshing to eat here.  Trendy and a bit over the top at times, it was all delicious and I had a lot of it.\n\nCosmopolitan is young, hip, and very much part of the in crowd right now.  They are close to City Center, but I don't think they are part of it.  Heck, they probably went all out and against the City Center.  Something about Cosmo doesn't exude the classic Las Vegas, but the new -- this is good and bad. I can see the direction they are taking this.  Everything flash, over the top, and gaudy.  Sinful, sin city, and wicked to say the least.  Las Vegas is evolving, and the Cosmopolitan is a testament of that.  Wicked Spoon is so different from the other Vegas buffets -- refreshing I would say.","review_id":"fIrjdirSLBuIuI4kEkl0yA","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":1,"useful":2,"user_id":"m33gSTi0Fyo3W2Qw6WVdtA","date":"2015-02-15"},{"cool":2,"text":"This rating combines 2 visits. \n\nWhen I first read about the Wicked Spoon on Yelp, many complained about the long lines to get in.  That just built up more anticipation. As luck would have it, a drive from LA took just enough time to arrive in Vegas around 1:30, perfect time to feed that hunger and avoid the lines. It took us about 10 minutes to get in on our first visit. \n\nThe size of the buffet with the modern decor greeted us, along with rows of dishes displayed in unique ways. Example, small pieces of golden friend chicken served in a little metal basket not only controls the portion, it also saves me plenty of room to sample everything else I've been eyeing. Unfortunately, the lunch rush was probably over and the kitchen became slow in refilling some of the empty slots. \n\nThe dessert section was a bit impressive, full of properly proportioned sweets and ice cream.  My only complaint is they put these tiny malt balls in their otherwise awesome coffee ice cream. Ruined! It's like pouring ketchup on steak. Yes, anything-to-do w/ coffee snob here.\n\nThe second visit a few months later was better. It was nearing the lunch hour as the line was longer this time, about 20 minutes. The line staff kept most of the trays filled as swarms of hungry people fought for prime position in front of certain stations. I passed and went for the immediate satisfaction. Still very good flavor. \n\nWe were very surprised to find French macarons at the dessert station this time. The server told us they bring it out early and once it's gone, that's it. This explains why we didn't see it the first time. So being a greedy sneak, I grabbed a few extra for later to go w/ a cappuccino. Real good! \n\nWill I go back? Hell yea! Is it my favorite? nah.

We headed back to the Wicked Spoon, anticipating the Dionysian food experience we had last time.  I thought that if we went a bit later, the midwest tourists accustomed to eating dinner at 6:00 p.m. would be tucked into their hotel beds or out getting drunk on the Strip.  So I figured that getting there about 7:45 would give us plenty of time to stuff our faces before the 9 o'clock closing.  Not so fast, cowgirl.\n\nThe line to pay was long and slow; not as long as at Disney, but long enough.  And this was a Thursday night.  Still, if we'd been seated right away, or after a reasonable wait, we still wouldn't have to eat fast and run.  But the line to get seated was as long as the line to pay.  Why?  Because clean, empty tables stayed empty, and staff was not bothering to clear obviously vacated ones.  It doesn't take a brain surgeon to determine that when all chairs are empty and napkins are atop dirty plates, those diners are dearly departed.\n\nWhile everyone was grumbling about the wait and the tables, no one, as usual, was speaking up except Ms. Bigmouth, yours truly.  But the manager gave me the usual song and dance and doubletalk. \n\nAt last, we got to eat.  And the manager came to our table shortly after to say that she decided to keep the food out for an extra half hour.  Still not enough time for what should have been a rather leisurely meal.\n\nIt turned out not to matter much.  The heretofore brilliant offerings were mostly pedestrian.  Oh, the usual crab legs and sushi were there.  Many of the dishes were still served on individual serving plates or bowls.  The lamb soup was excellent.  But beyond that, there was nothing outstanding to choose from.  We sampled enough of a variety of items to come to the sad conclusion that the food was basically tasteless.  Salmon was dry and way overcooked.  The Chinese dishes were among the most uninspired, ordinary food ever to grace a pair of chopsticks.  Even the gelato was missing flavor.\n\nThe room itself is lacking atmosphere - not elegant, nor even hi-tech like Bacchanal.  It's just a room, not even as pretty as the one at the Red Rock Buffet.\n\nAnd speaking of Red Rock, the food's better, the service is better, and with a player's card it'll set you back only $14, instead of the outrageous $41 at Wicked Spoon.

We enjoyed Thanksgiving here so much last year, that we decided to go back this year.  They still had an expedited wait through the line \"to pay\" for Gold/Platinum Marriott Rewards members, but this year we had to wait in line for a table with everyone else, which was about an hour at 2:30pm.   The young lady who seated us was very nice and friendly, however she was the only one.  The rest of the staff was extremely rude or they were sarcastic. We paid for the brunch at 2:30pm.  However, when we went to order mimosas, which are supposed to be included on the brunch, we were told it was after 3pm and it was not included in the dinner and alcohol was separate.  We paid for brunch, we should have had mimosas.  But we were screwed out of it.   I ordered Ginger Ale to drink, and it tasted like Coke & Sprite mixed together.  The selections were EXTREMELY limited and were terrible.  It seems like whoever was the head chef has been watching too much Food Network.  There were some very strange combinations.  No salad bar, just some very weird salads and pasta salad choices.  Instead of the chestnut stuffing from last year, they had \"pork, leek, chestnut stuffing\".  The only veggies they had were mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, some horrible looking Brussels Sprouts loaded with bacon, some bourbon glazed carrots that looked terrible and that was basically it.  There were no green beans, no regular carrots, no broccoli, no cauliflower, no peas, no squash, no zucchini.  The hottest item seemed to be the pizza, because it was always gone.  There was some hot and spicy mac & cheese, but no regular mac & cheese.  There was plenty of Asian food, but even most of that I didn't recognize what it was and it looked disgusting.  I had a piece of prime rib, when I got it, it was RAW, and I don't mean rare, I mean RAW.  When I brought it to my waiter's attention, he asked why I didn't ask the carver to put it on the grill a little longer.  i didn't know that was an option?!  The person carving the meat should have brought that to my attention.  The turkey was ok, but not great.  The gravy was great, probably the highlight of the meal.  Once again, the mashed potatoes had the skin in them, they were lumpy and needed gravy for seasoning.  Besides the gelatti and sorbetti, the desert choices looked very average.  You would think on Thanksgiving, they would have some pumpkin, sweet potato, apple, or pecan pie... they did not.  I saw much better selections on EVERYTHING the last time I was at one of the Station Casino buffets.  I know this place has been through some ownership changes over the past year, but I didn't know that the changes would trickle down to this very successful venue.  Needless to say, this was our last Thanksgiving here and our last time here period.  What a disappointment for our meal and our Thanksgiving overall.  One more thing, my sister is Vegan.  They had no Vegan or Vegetarian offerings.  And I saw Gluten-Free and Sugar Free desserts, but no Gluten Free/Allergy Sensitive offerings for dinner.

However, much of my food was cold (when it shouldn't be) I would speculate because they probably do not preheat the plates and personal size serving pans prior to plating the food thus the food immediately starts to cool down. Also, the \"fries with eyes\" was greasy (and cold) indicative that they did not heat the oil enough. \n\nHowever, I will say I was impressed that they had bone marrow! and prime rib bones - yum.

The gnocchi with lamb ragu left something to be desired, while the ragu in itself was tasty, the gnocchi was the consistency of balls of mashed potatoes. \n\nHands down, and quite frankly what pushes this from 3 1/2 stars to 4 stars for me is the dessert bar.

They have various foods you don't find at any other, like bone marrow, for example.  Given that they place most food portions in either mini pots or frying baskets, or small plates, I like it.  Personally, I like keeping my food separate so they don't mix in together, so their style suits me well.  It's also for freshness reasons.  Imagine a large vat of salad like you see at most buffets.  Notice how the bottom part of it ends up soggy?  With the small plates of salad, for example, when placed in individual plates, it stays fresher and doesn't get all yucky.  Saves them money that way, too.  \n\nThe dessert table was my favorite.

I love the small portions and the whimsy of the mini pots and fryer baskets. It makes you not load up on a particular thing so you have room to enjoy the other things they've prepared. Not your average buffet fare of crusty eggs, bacon, and packaged salad. The food is very unique and ever changing, so if you go two days in a row you'll definitely have different things. I appreciate that. They even changed out some items while we sat. Definitely go for the all-you-can-drink package for $8 more. The drinks aren't strong at all, but it's still not a bad deal. \nI really enjoyed eating here and will come again, perhaps it will be my only buffet stop in Vegas!","review_id":"xuOZoLfqBK7oyLGDY79sMg","stars":5,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"XNo1t-nDl_mN4B34uSHifA","date":"2012-05-01"},{"cool":1,"text":"There's only one thing that made this 4 instead of 5 stars, and that would be the fact that there's no preferred/player's club line.

Yes, sometimes it's a little inconvenient or embarrassing if you'd like to get a bunch of something, but it also kind of helped encourage you to get different items.  So, not an issue for me.

(You don't understand how excited I am to be back just so that  I can write this review for you...LOL!)  So without any further delays, let me share with you what I've discovered while I'm there for a very short, quick, and fun weekend!\n\nCOSMOPOLITAN.... A brand spanking new hotel sitting right next to Bellagio, has finally opened up it's doors to the glitzy lights of Vegas.  Even though this review is not about COSMO, let me tell you a little bit about it....  This is a Marriott created hotel (NOT part of the City Center / MGM Group), it's got the Planet Hollywood hip feel to it, but man... the design was just to...CRAMMED!  They try to squeeze so much decor into this place that they made it feel so small!  Anyway, there is your sneak peak into COSMO... please do read my future reviews on this place... (Or check it out yourself!)\n\nSo the highlight of this review of course is the Wicked Spoon Buffet.  Like what I would usually do now once I'm at a location I'll check in on yelp and try to read the reviews prior.  So before deciding to give this place a try I found out that it's a Tapas-Style buffet.  I was like \"huh?\" but let me tell you... what an awesome concept this place is!!!\n\nSo we went for lunch (The dinner the night before was insane with lines snaking throughout the buffet so decided to delay my experience)  No lines at 2:30pm, got in immediately, and off to the food we went...\n\nLet's start with the drinks like how a normal meal would go... we asked for ice tea, coke, lemonade, and water... all were normal except for the water!  It was Aquahealth water (http://www.aquahealth.com/)...Never heard of it but it was some really delicious dispensed water!  (Very much like Voss Water for those of you have tried that before!)\n\nThe food was simply crazy!  Everything pretty much was served in small portions but all in miniature cookwares!  (small pots and pans, frying basket, etc.)  So the presentation was 5 stars right there!\n\nFood was decent tasting.... (sweet potato fries in small basket, dungeonese crab claws on porcelain dishes, white truffle risotto in an All-Clad like sauce pan (mini-version!) and many many more!  Unfortunately I can tell you everything I've had simply because there were no names but a description in front of each of the servings (much like an high-end restaurant), but all the food tasted pretty good and you can definitely tell that they focused on the quality and not just quantity.  The only complaint that I would have with this place is properly the warmth of the food served... again, this place was opened 10 days ago so I'm gonna let that go...(thus the -1 star)  I'm sure that once they have everything in place things will be simply awesome!  (But they do have a pretty decent selection of food available all in Tapas-Style servings!)\n\nThe mini-dessert island is no joke!  Everything was all attention to detail oriented so it's awesome to see it being displayed!   But their highlights of the dessert island was the following in my personal opinion...\n\nMadelines:  Mini madelines super buttery yet soft!  OMG.... it is one of the best I've had and it's super cute!  Tiny and delicious!!! (great poppers!)\n\nGelato Bar:  10 flavors to choose from!  Al delicious and not overly sweet!  (Like They Cup in City Center)  Great flavor and just right!  Served in mini cones!\n\nChocolate Dipped Strawberries:  THE BIGGEST AND SWEETEST Choco-dipped strawberries I've seen in my life!  And it was simply the best period...  Imagine... wait staff on their break getting some food to the back breakroom..... what's on their plate?  Only Choco-dipped Strawberries....  Gotta Get'em All!!!!!  You will not regret trying this for sure!\n\nFinally, the service was awesome!  Our waitress was super nice, attentive, and very accommodating!  Again I can't imagine how they will be once they are finally all in sync with this place say a month from now...  It's gonna be awesome and I'm already looking forward to it!  So kudos to the awesome service training!\n\nOne ending high note.... we spoke with one of the managers Jackie (totally funny, awesome, and again, accommodating to the max!)  She mentioned that currently her head chef is driving her nuts!  He is literally creating new dishes on the fly on almost a daily basis (in 10 days of opening they had 7 menu change!)  She said that so many locals came here several days in a roll just to see what's new the next day!  That is simply crazy, I personally don't think they can keep that up, but if they do... I will almost have to rank them higher than my all time favorite Sterling Buffet...\n\nSo... let's get the food hot and tasty, and keep the inspirations flowing on a daily basis.... Wicked spoon....I'm hoping that you can be my new number one on my buffet favorites list!  Trust me... that will be some accomplishment!\n\nWickedly Awesome!","review_id":"uOKnpVS21uT0Bp9fTQ30yA","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":10,"useful":22,"user_id":"sys6XtOZVLDzwn3qistBKw","date":"2010-12-29"},{"cool":0,"text":"One of my favorite buffets in Vegas.

I took my neice here for her 25th bday because of the great reviews and how popular this place was.  It was a Monday night and we got here a little after 7 pm and after walking the wrong too far in the wrong direction because of bad signage on the first floor, we found the buffet and not a single person was in line. (This should've been our sign right there to turn around and leave)  \n\nSo we pay and get sat and I treat her to a bottle of wine for $20 \n\nNow I want to stop here for a 2nd and mention on it's own, this place gets a 2, if compared to the new Bacchanal buffet at Ceasars, this place gets a 1. I definitely give credit to Caesars for trying to be better then this place.  \n\nSo after we were sat, and started upto the buffet, there was basically no line anywhere, the place was fairly quiet and empty. I know it's a Monday but still, I've seen all sorts of buffets packed on a Monday at 7 pm   So we start in the asian section, Ummm where's the asian section?  It was SOOOO basic and minimal it was a freakin joke.  Caesars had a much bigger variety and more specialty items. I've seen cheap small buffets have more of an asian section. The sushi selection here was literally a joke and was NOT worth the almost $40 per person I just paid.  As we walked along, we had to keep coming back to the table because after you pick up 2 or 3 items, you barely have any food but you have all these damm freakin little pots and baskets and stuff.  Ok I get it, it's cute and it's looks good for individual portions but ultimately the idea SUCKS. Almost everything we tried back at our table was not hot and was barely room temperature.  I will say the risotto was excellent and other then that 1 item, NOTHING made us go oooh and ahhh  or omg I have got to get another one of these.  The 1st basket of calamari was good but not great and we decided to go back later for a 2nd basket, it was SO salty we had to spit it out.   The seafood section was worthless. They didn't even have oysters of ANY type (fried or on the halfshell)  Yet even cheap basic buffets throughout the city have oysters on the half shell?  Why does the $40 buffet not have them??? Hmmmmm \n\nOh and after our very attentive waiter brought us our wine, we was hardly ever around and hard to find to pay the check. We almost walked out on him.\n\nSo we move onto the dessert section and between the 2 of us we basically get 1 of everything, We did not finish a single piece of ANY dessert. It was so blah and basic and not one piece of chocolate went OHHHHHH YUMMMMM .  \n\nWHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWe left full but not satisfied.  Quite frankly I will NOT be recommending this place and I have no desire to come back.  \n\nJust for the record, even though the Bacchanal buffet at caesars wasn't great, it was definitely VERY good and FAR better then this buffet.  I was quite disappointed because this was not what I was expecting.","review_id":"K16ptQLV3huO3SDHuHJ0eA","stars":2,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A","date":"2012-12-14"},{"cool":4,"text":"For $40 I thought this was a pretty darn good deal. Nice ambiance, service, and best of all, really good and interesting food. You won't find any gross giant chafing dishes of buffet food here; instead, most items come on their own individual serving plates/dishes, which contributes to the high-end feel of this place. While they have your prime rib (excellent), pasta, and all the other usual dishes you expect at a buffet, they also offered some some out-of-ordinary fare which I greatly enjoyed, like the roast bone marrow (accompanied by toast and sea salt, yum!), sauteed calves liver, and beef tongue shepherd's pie. They had a kale salad that was divine, and there was very little to fault with any other offerings I tried. I thought the Korean BBQ galbi was a little on the fatty side, but not bad. Their dessert selection was pretty outstanding as well, with a Thai Iced Tea ice cream that was out of this world! My friends and I had a great time and was appropriately stuffed by the time we waddled out of there.

So glad we came to try this buffet out. My boyfriend came here after our hike at Mount Charleston. We were hungry for a buffet and I decided it's time to try this place out. It was $28 a person for brunch which is 8am-5pm? We got here around 3:30pm. One thing I didn't like was that they only had one person at the front checking people in when there was like 5 people up front at the register. Not sure what they were doing but only one was working the register so the customers had to wait to pay and get seated. When we got seated it took a while for our server to come over to take our drink order. After that our server was there for most of the time to check on us but she disappeared at the end too. What I liked was the water jug was available at every table. I liked pouring our own water. The seats were comfortable and the design inside the buffet was very pleasant. I loved the inside of the buffet. My favorite part is the small bowls they serve the food in! It is so cute ! I love eating like that. My favorite was the chicken curry, the oxtail soup, the cheese section, the crab legs at 5pm, and the fruits they had. My boyfriend loved their orange chicken they had. I wish they had more sushi options and more Chinese food in the Asian section. The oxtail soup broth was very delicious. I slurped the broth down. I wish they had beef balls for the oxtail soup pho. I loved the noodles and condiments that came with it only wish there was some kind of extra protein to go with it. \nI didn't understand the omelette or seafood station area. There was seafood but you had to ask them to cook for you not sure what they were cooking. Overall I would definitely come back for their buffet.","review_id":"UEJyLpdwiVakw5Tn2_WU5w","stars":5,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"lQBZo8_mm80dbwI5bo5c_w","date":"2017-06-26"},{"cool":1,"text":"Man oh man, I really wanted to like this place.

We got into Wicked Spoon with two-for-one coupons and line passes for Sunday lunch--a great deal, and one of the best buffet meals I've had in town. Many thanks to you, Justin.\n\nWe were seated right away, and a waiter took our drink order. I got a bottomless Bloody Mary for an $13. It was quite good, spicy and satisfying, and our waiter replaced it without prompting and without comment, whenever it got close to empty. This waiter was great, by the way. He didn't have to do very much for us, and he still managed to come off as wonderfully pleasant and attentive. Or maybe he just bribed me with those fast booze refills.\n\nMy favorite thing about buffets is that you can start eating immediately, and as soon as we secured our table and ordered our drinks, we hit the various stations. The spread was diverse and extravagant, and I filled up plates in a few different rounds. My husband and I have very different palates, and it was funny how little overlap there was between our plates. He got stuff like carved beef and macaroni and, good lord, bread, while I created a monstrosity of a lunch made up of stir-fried noodles, fried rice, teriyaki chicken, sushi, curried beef, curried lamb, gnocchi, and on and on and on. I thought the presentation was pretty appetizing across the board, with a lot of dishes individually portioned in attractive little containers. Definitely a step up, even visually, from your standard buffet. The food was also quite tasty, most of it not memorable but very good to eat. The bone marrow was probably the highlight, and I understand why it's the thing to get at Wicked Spoon. Where else can you have AYCE bone marrow? When we went, it came with a lovely kimchi glaze, and it was delicious. I filled up on savory stuff and mostly ignored the dessert table (buffet pastries are never as good as they look, and always make me feel bad), but went straight for the gelato station. Great gelato. I had some strawberry balsamic and pistachio gelato, and both hit the spot. I would've been perfectly happy if I'd gotten this gelato at its own shop.\n\nI don't think I'd wait in a huge line and pay full boat to get into Wicked Spoon (I'd probably do one or the other), but I enjoyed my lunch and thought it was a great value at half price. If you're looking for the full Vegas buffet experience, this place must be one of your best options.","review_id":"Mk6wTbFJ9UtYNLhsG8Xdrw","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":1,"useful":7,"user_id":"WWnhqRnWWjutMqh-2SzEuQ","date":"2015-03-13"},{"cool":0,"text":"Generally, I hate buffets.

Came here for dinner, $35 + tax & tip.  Wicked Spoon is actually one of my favorite buffets in Vegas now, if not my favorite for dinner.\n\nWe got there before the buffet had reopened for dinner at 5pm, so we lined up and waited about 15 minutes before getting seated.  The service at Wicked Spoon wasn't so great... it was a while before anyone came by to take our drink orders, and we had some difficulty flagging down the waiter responsible for our table.\n\nBut other than that, the food was \"great\" - and by great, I mean pretty good by normal standards and great by buffet standards.  It's a little pricier than your regular Rio buffet, but they offer a much more creative menu.  And unlike the Paris and Wynn buffets, Wicked Spoon actually executes a good amount of these dishes well!\n\nMemorable dishes:\n-Bone marrow + sea salt + crostinis (you can get the toast points by the cheese section)\n-Some pork dish marinated in wine with olives (served inside a mini tin pot) - can't remember the specific name but this was surprisingly good\n-Southern-fried steak & gravy over some sort of polenta\n-Ceviche shooters\n-Gelato bar\n-Chocolate & nut/oreo covered strawberries\n\nThe crab legs were kinda wimpy, but at least they were pre-cut.  I'm usually not too impressed with most of the meats at buffets (prime rib, lamb, etc.) and Wicked Spoon was alright... not egregious but obviously not as good as what you would get at a nice restaurant.  The main reason why I enjoyed Wicked Spoon so much was because of their smaller plate dishes.\n\nOverall, I felt like the quality at Wicked Spoon was a lot more like a restaurant than a buffet, which is great.  Yes, not all the dishes were amaaazing but since it's a buffet, you can just go get something else!  If I spent $40 at a restaurant with comparable menu offerings, I would probably leave feeling just as satisfied as I did after Wicked Spoon - and that's saying a lot for a buffet!","review_id":"gHY3K-oqi2JYGT9MwJXS3g","stars":5,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":4,"useful":5,"user_id":"tduMSflg1bhAFDgWOr4MPg","date":"2011-08-10"},{"cool":0,"text":"Service is slow - waiter only checks on the table 2 times it seems like during your entire visit.

It has metallic ornaments hanging from the ceiling and I'm not sure what they're supposed to be or represent or how it compliments the name of \"Wicked Spoon\".  The rest of the dining area is kind of dark and woodsy.  Overall, the ambiance  is kind of random and haphazard. But then because it is in Cosmo, the environment is kinda gorgeous. \n\nHowever, the use of mini skillets and cups containing smaller portions of food.  While I like this approach as a means of controlling the size of my portions, it gets annoying placing these items in my plate with other items.  I have no idea how many people have touched those containers and I certainly don't want them touching my other foods.  Additionally, those containers are bulky and take a lot of space on my plate.  \n\nFOOD VARIETY:  \nLack of decent salad bars, which offered 2 choices of premade salads in small bowls. Which is okay for me because Im not really a salad girl. The appetizer/ hor'derve/ pre-meal area consisted mostly of different types of breads, small cups of shrimp cocktails (2 small shrimps per cup). \n\nThe breakfast station offered pancakes and french toast and then as I walked a half foot further I saw tacos and Mexican dishes.  In between the breakfast and Mexican station was a section for toppings for both pancakes and tacos.  As I mentioned before, Wicked Spoon was way too haphazard in its presentation and organization.  \n\nThere was an Italian station where you could have a pasta cooked in front of you with your favorite ingredients by a chef.  They also had an omelet station, crepe station, and panang station where you could also make the aforementioned items cooked to your specifications.   \n\nThe Wicked Spoon offers a lot of meat at the meat station and they have large cuts of bacon, ham, sausage, lamb,  prime rib, and Korean BBQ and some turkey thing covered in teriyaki sauce. They also had crappy sushi that I didn't touch  and some Vietnamese Bahn Mi sandwiches, which I wasn't interested in because it was pork based.  oh, they also have miso soup at this station.\n\nWicked Spoon offer a diverse and tasty variety of desserts. There's plenty of dessert pics so you can see for yourself what Wicked Spoon has to offer.  I recommend the cheesecake.  The cookies were rock hard and inedible.  The gelato was mediocre.  \n\nSERVICE:  \n\n\nCONCLUSION: \nThe Wicked Spoon is all hype.  I attribute the high reviews to a large number of female reviewers who enjoy trendy new things and tasty desserts. Overall, I was thrilled with the value and the variety of Wicked Spoon.  I will clearly be coming here again, but for true seafood lovers, I can see them liking Bellagio, Wynn, or Sterling more. they don't seem to have my macarons and my chocolate cones!","review_id":"kpkzSkl5OGIRX9SyOxIgMA","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"BTsyCC8AmftuDQCDTqBDAw","date":"2012-04-06"},{"cool":1,"text":"Wicked Spoon Buffet is greater than thr Wynn Buffet!\n\nCame here for lunch on a Friday ($22) around 11:30am: line was about a 20 minute wait tops. \n\nCompared to the Wynn, the presentation of food was better: the food was served in baby status bowls and pots..

Our server Will was fantabulous - attentive, sense of humor, super fast on drink requests and refills.  He gave Eric R. three sprite refills at one time since he was unusually thirsty for soda, something he never drinks.  The iced tea was good - definitely brewed and not Lipton.  It was sort of oolong ish.  Will was the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one.\n\nYes, the plates are awkward.  You can fit like 3 or 4 items at a time, they are clunky and sliding everywhere.  Will told us he can only clear one person's mess at a time, which slows down his progress.  The worst for me was the lack of signage.  Personally, I don't like to put a bunch of food in my mouth that has no distinguishing characteristics.  What the heck were in half the dishes?!  I honestly have no idea.  I wasn't in the mood for an omelette, so everything was out of my control.\n\nThe shrimp and crab fingers - served in pairs already in sauce...yuk.  Almost every dish I could find, labeled or not, had pork in it, except carving station stuff.  Pasta, shrimp dishes, creamed corn, you name it, it was pork-infested.  With limited options, I didn't enjoy much except the make-your-own noodle bowl station at the end of the buffet.\n\nThe desserts were worse - nothing was labeled except the gelato.  I didn't know what the hot pink goo was or the purple fudge looking stuff was, so I didn't get any of that.  I asked Will why the food wasn't labeled.

First, this Buffet is WAY, WAY over priced. To come to this conclusion you have to really see what's going on here. They have layed out this buffet In such a way as to save money and short change the customer as much as possible. The Single portions may be cute and all, but if you look at what's there they are skimping on things that cost the most money. Pork ribs with risotto. Large portion of risotto with 3 tinny bits of pork. Interesting! Any dish with rice was 98% rice and almost no meat. This was all over the buffet right down to the extremely thin straws they give you for your soda. The slower you drink the less refills they have to give you.\n     also, the reason I came to this buffet was to try the bone marrow. I made sure to call SEVERAL times to find out if they serve it every night. I was told this was a staple of there buffet and one of the things that sets them apart from other buffets so they have it every night. Guess what they didn't have the night I was there? Of course, the bone marrow. I did talk to the manager about this and he told me they had run out the night before. He then said he would like to invite me to come back to try the bone marrow another time. I'm not sure what that means but I don't think it was going to be for free. I would not have had a problem with it if I didn't call repeatedly and was told they have it every night. \n        I have also read in other reviews that people had a hard time getting refills of soda after there first one. This happened to me as well. It seemed like after I asked the waitress for my first refill she just disappeared and never came around again. Interesting for a buffet that's $38 with tax. \n        I will say, much of the food was very good. I did enjoy most of what I had. The carving station did have some very good meats. The desserts were also rather good. \n        I don't think I will be back to this buffet as there are many in Vegas that I enjoy more and are cheaper.

I wasn't really hungry when I came here but when I walked over to the dessert I had to try some of their sorbets and the mango sorbet tasted like mangos.

Last time, the mister came out here, the line was hella long, so his experience was a little tainted.  For my first time, I wanted to make sure that we got their early so we can avoid the lines.  \n\nThe buffet opens at 8AM on Saturdays, so tried to get there when it first opened.  We arrived past 9AM and I was scared to find a huge line awaiting us, but luckily there was none.  We were seated right away.  \n\nI love the decor. Very modern.  It didn't feel like a typical buffet. They had very creative menu selections like corned beef hash eggs benedict, salted caramel pancakes, gnocchi, and very cool desserts like berry fudge.  I also liked how some of the food is served in cute small individual pans and their fried chicken in a wire basket.  The food quality was really good, but I am not giving Wicked Spoon 5 stars because they didn't offer many seafood selections.  Crab legs and oysters would be nice. Also, if you want mimosas, it's $8 extra, but they didn't tell me that until after I was seated and the waiter asked what we wanted to drink. So, they had to give us another check before we left.  They should charge for that when we first paid.  \n\nService was okay. Even though our waiter was nice, It took awhile to get refills on our mimosas and coffee.\n\nAlso, now that I have a baby, I have another criteria I look for in restaurants...diaper changing stations in the restrooms.  You'd be surprised how important this feature is until you have kids.  Fortunately, they have a family restroom w/ a changing station near the front entrance of the restaurant.  They don't have changing station in the restroom inside the restaurant, which I thought was a huge oversight.\n\nOverall, Wicked Spoon is one of the better Vegas buffets out there.  Just make sure you get there before 10AM on the weekends because when we got out at 11A, the line was pretty long.","review_id":"AI7Icq8kFkcUXbWQJae3ew","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":2,"useful":3,"user_id":"IOC3Iuu8t3hhtPMt9ibmpQ","date":"2012-02-21"},{"cool":0,"text":"I am not a buffet person.

Some other standouts for me were the polenta with pesto and blue cheese, also the scrumptious paella, knocked my socks off, I could taste the saffron for sure.  I loved the mini wedge salad too, so cute.  Other nice touches were the bottled water and prompt service.  But the best part of it all is the dessert area, OMGeeee!  Just outstanding so much variety and great quality.  I think the selection of gelato flavors deserves an award.  There is everything you can think of too, I enjoyed the peach cobbler with vanilla gelato and the carrot cake but the most  wonderful surprise were the peach marshmallows, holy heaven those were just devine!

Honestly, these buffets have lotsa food options, not necessarily anything super crazy! Just lotsa options, and some stuff is staler than other stuff.

If you aren't a bottomless pit with eating powers equivalent to the Rock or Michael Phelps, Wicked Spoon might be a better choice since it's significantly cheaper. One edge Wicked Spoon does have is dessert- presentation is overall tighter with better flavor and precision than Bacchanal.\n\nWeekday dinner was $38 a person. (They do have military discount, btw!) As with any buffet, you can expect food to die under heat lamps, and some of it dies hard here. (Beef Au Poivre was more like Beef Au Jerky.) \n\nThey have an all-you-can-enjoy mimosa dealio with brunch or red/white wine for dinner. Both are about $12 extra, which is pretty dang amaze if you can put some booze down! Non-alcoholic beverages are included into the price, including Cokes, juices, coffee, and tea! \n\nWicked Spoon kinda does that weird thing where you pay up first and can include your tip on there before receiving service. I'm glad I left a tip on the table since the guy Bill was phenomenal and so kind, and that way I could leave my server extra! \n\nAnd last, my personal tip for being able to eat dessert like a champ: saving dessert for last is for rookies and grandmas.

We have just plain stopped getting it.  A waste. \n\nThen all of the single serving pastas and such are dried out from sitting too long.  My chicken wings were pink on the inside.  The one guy was overwhelmed at the eggs Benedict and he didn't have any out at all.  He was filling the French toast and pancakes with premade refills from the back and said it would be 3-4 minutes for the eggs Benedict.  I just leave and eat my first servings and go back and he still has not started any.  By then, the French toast is gone again and he is again just refilling with not fresh refills from the back.  Meaning he pulls the Saran Wrap off the top from the back while we watch.  Nothing is fresh anymore.  I've also seen them just pull the Saran Wrap off the sushi now.  All this is fine for the 7.99 buffets, but at $28 for lunch and $48 for dinner, quality is expected.  \n\nPoor aloof service from waiters more concerned with bussing their table for new customers than waiting on the ones they have.  They aren't waiters, they are busboys.  \n\nThey have also taken the chocolate strawberries from the dessert table.  Everything here is now skimped and cheapened and they know they are packing in the people from their reputation and now they can glide by on that.   \n\nThe steak is still always good and served a nice medium rare.  That chicken mushroom potato stew is good over the mashed.  And the tres de leche and gelatos are good.  But before there were a dozen fun and inspired dishes and now there are 2-3 things that are good, but that is not what a high end buffet is supposed to be.  Very disappointed the last 3-4 times.  We looked forward to coming here and I even started recommending to people.  My recommendation is now rescinded.  They are dialing it in and cutting staff and cutting corners.","review_id":"YiFL8j0c_lxzYwqT8FaGnw","stars":2,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"WIu4IqktLQ6Qm46L5r5Baw","date":"2017-07-25"},{"cool":4,"text":"I've been brokenhearted by a buffet again.\n\nOkay, not as badly as what happened with Studio B at M - I would still go to Wicked Spoon if someone else was paying and be able to find something vegetarian that's not a single, sad pasta dish - but things have changed.\n\nDid it get more expensive? It seems like it has, or maybe just the sensation of poor value on our last visit made me think so.\n\nYes, that last visit... where I actually had to get a slice of pizza because the vegetarian pickings were much harder to come by.

No!)\n\nBut heck, I still did better than my (non-veg) husband, who walked the buffet line twice before he said to me, all the color drained out of his face as he realized that his fave buffet no longer existed, \"There's nothing here that I want!\"\n\nThis isn't to say that the number of offerings has diminished or the quality has gone down, although I will point out that the custom mac and cheese station now has far fewer choices and desserts seem to have more duplication across the space than before.\n\nNo, instead it's become yet another buffet that caters to the fishy-minded. It's like someone said, \"Okay, let's just pile a bunch of seafood over here, for Joe and Mary Middle-America, and let's pile a bunch of fish-based Asian fare next to it, for our many Asian guests.\"\n\nNow, for most of the people, I get that there's NO problem with this scenario. People do love them some crab legs, what-what. And usually my husband only needs a halfway-decent Asian section and he's all thumbs up. \n\nBut like I said - VERY fish-based now, and ole Mike doesn't like fish.\n\nWe both ate mostly pilaf (absolutely delicious) and went home feeling a bit ill over the money spent.\n\nPilaf aside, most of what I tried was decent-tasting but unremarkable. Tone down the interesting dishes, and what else can you expect?

For 27 bucks for dinner, one of the cheaper gourmet buffet options on the Strip. \n\nWicked Spoon's concept is a buffet tapas thing - everything in small portions on small plates. Unfortunately, there are several problems: one, the stations aren't very clearly labeled. So you have to wander around a bit to figure out the layout and there are a couple of stations I didn't really get. (I THINK it's a make-your-own-Thai-rice-noodle-soup station at the end of the Asian portion.)\n\nThe second problem is that any time you plate several small plates on top of a larger one, they start to slide around as you walk. And it made for stacking the dirty dishes difficult for the waitstaff. Who, coincidentally, are not super amazing at their jobs. I can't IMAGINE what the dishwashing looks like behind the scenes.\n\nOverall, there was a wide range of food options. I enjoyed an udon noodle stirfry, some Korean riblets, and the little shrimp cocktails. Lamb chops in olives and artichoke hearts was a stand out, if they could get some more olive flavor into the meat. We also uniformly enjoyed the sausage in balsamic grilled grapes. (Okay, not exactly sure what this was, wish I'd taken better notes. Sorry Yelp.)\n\nI see that other Yelpers have given the Asian section bad reviews but I honestly thought it was one of the better Asian sections on a buffet in town. Less focus on sushi, and more on regional foods that don't always show up on a buffet line. (Probably because middle America is just getting around to trying it.)\n\nWe didn't like the already-lumped crab. It was chewy and overdone and we all commented that we preferred the mess of shelling it because it usually tasted better. Other misses: lamb ragu with gnocchi. Saffron cod barely tasted saffrony. \n\nDessert was eh, but we didn't have any of the gelato. I did like that they had a bowl of mixed berries - should have stuck to this, a bit of fresh cheese and bread off the salad line and gone with a European dessert. The cheese selection is quite nice for a buffet in this price range.\n\nI hate to feel so mixed. I'm sure management will dumb this place down soon, so go experience it for yourself before they do.","review_id":"8dfsQIGwG-Txmk29IZVeHQ","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":1,"useful":0,"user_id":"BemKKkZBBmu9GupEwKBj9g","date":"2011-01-07"},{"cool":0,"text":"Even thought it was a little pricey for what you get we really enjoyed the buffet.

So I've been having a hard time deciding if Bacchanal buffet at Caeser's or this buffet was the winner... It seems like each time I go to either one, it's just too hard to decide!\n\nAnyways, based on my most recent experience here, I've come to the conclusion that this buffet is very good still... but Bacchanal buffet is the clear winner. I've been here numerous times... at least 5 or 6... and it seems like it was never as good as it was when I first tried it. Now, that may have been because it was all new and the concept of how they served things was new in the buffet world... but now that more places are doing the same thing - those individual sized servings, the food here seems to have gone down in quality. \n\nThe last time I went was the last time I went to Vegas, just this past January. The food selection is not as vast as Caeser's... and unfortunately, some of the food I had was not as hot or fresh as it should have been. I think part of that problem is that a lot of hungry customers have been venturing out to other buffets and so the turnover of food as not what it used to be and so the food sits out longer... Don't get me wrong, much of the food here still tastes very good... but it didn't have quite the wow factor of Caeser's. The prime rib here was very yummy though. Very juicy and tender!\n\nThe good thing here is that the prices are much better than at Caeser. It's less than $40 for dinner compared to over $50 at Bacchanal over at Caeser's. The place is still very clean and the decor is very nice. I've always have nice servers that are attentive and work hard. It seems like they have thrown out lunch here altogether and it's either brunch or dinner. They do have a 2 hour period here between the meals which is apparently their \"happy hour\". I have never gone to that, so I do not know what that means for a buffet... unfortunately, it seems like you cannot go here for lunch in hopes of getting dinner food instead because of this \"happy hour\".","review_id":"Z4HkUb6jLGJD2TZo9PHbig","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"4AYfs8d7M2H4TBEiHhHTdQ","date":"2014-03-28"},{"cool":0,"text":"After coming here about 6 times in the past 3 years I have to say I am not quite as impressed as I once was.

First things first I walk the buffet and check what they have to offer. No crab legs, I'm assuming that's only a dinner option now. Fine with me. The sushi selection was pretty weak too, veggie roll, California roll, and shrimp tempura. No prime rib, although they did have the Korean short ribs. One of the tastier options. Chicken wings were good too, but if I really wanted chicken wings I shoulda just went to BBW. I also had a few breakfast items like pancakes and the eggs Benedict. Pancakes were delicious with the strawberry compote. The eggs Benedict was nothing memorable. The variety of desserts were good, but no macaroons.

There were stations for breakfast foods, fruits and vegetables, carved meats, Italian, Asian, and pastries/desserts.  The staff was friendly and efficient (especially our waitress, Lisa!).  It's a very pretty restaurant, rich in ambers and browns.  I particularly liked the amber-colored glass-drops that were suspended like raindrops around large glass structures (like unlit chandeliers).  The buffet is pricey -- another example of how the days of the $12 Vegas buffet are gone, I think, at least for high-quality food -- but you can eat your fill of good food.","review_id":"WCMjPsx2oWVPi4_U8wMadQ","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"oBhQMjrT0zdSLdlybWRA_w","date":"2014-09-07"},{"cool":0,"text":"I was very sad to learn that there was no mac and cheese bar at lunch... however, this place gets 4 stars for:\n\n1.

So that's the story of how bf & I ended up at Wicked Spoon Buffet last Friday.  The rave reviews & my friend who's a local telling me how much she loves it helped too.\n\nWe arrived a little before 11 & only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated at a table.  Apparently Monday thru Fridays before 2 brunch is served with a complimentary glass of Champagne, Mimosa, or Bloody Mary.  That was definitely a nice addition to the $22 pp (pre-tax) meal.  Tip can also be added up front at the podium.  \n\n*My Favorite Dishes: Kalbi, short rib & caramelized onion Pizza, mac n cheese w/Ham, fried chicken.  OMG these were all so good I got seconds on all of them!  The Kalbi had lots of flavor and the right amount of saltiness.  The pizza was so delish.  The mac n cheese had a nice crust on top and wasn't overly cheesy & the ham worked well.  The fried chicken had a nice crispiness.\n*Oh So Yummy Desserts: Tiramisu Gelato & assorted steroid huge chocolate covered strawberries!  Lemon-moussey cake-like thingy.  The chocolate covered marshmallow with a light pistachio dusting was good too as well as a passion fruit macaroon cookie stuffed with a raspberry.  \n*The Okays: Prime Rib (bf loved it tho).  I must comment though I got a nice medium rare piece of Prime Rib, which I was happy about because I think that's the only way steaks/prime ribs should be cooked!  House smoked bacon didn't have much smokiness taste, green beans w/ tangerine and sushi were alright.  Chicken apple sausage could have used more flavor as it was fairly bland.  The other desserts that I took a bite of but couldn't finish cuz I was about to explode!\nThe Dislikes: Pork Belly Fried Rice was bland, bummer because I was so excited to eat it up.  The short rib caveteli pasta was the only pasta from the pasta section that I tried.  I think the cheese is what turned me off, it was either Gorgonzola or Blue Cheese; I didn't think it worked at all.  The hash browns were flavorless. The BLT Salad just lacked pizzaz!  \n\nBetter than Bellagio & Aria buffet for sure.  I haven't been to the Wynn Buffet in three years & that was my favorite that I tried up until this trip.  I had heard that it wasn't what it used to be so I can compare it totally against Wicked Spoon.  But Wicked Spoon is so yummy I just wish I had more room in my tummy.  I was so stuffed by the time dessert came along I only finished about three items on my dessert plates.   Besides the lovely decor of the buffet, I love how everything's portion served in little bowls and plates, and the fried chicken was served in a mini deep fryer.  I'm rating it a 5 for now because I did have some really good food here and you can't always win, there will always be some dishes at a buffet that just aren't great, but my last trip out I wasn't really satisfied with the food I got after my meals, this time I sure was!    Next Vegas trip we will be hitting up Wicked Spoon again, question is, lunch or dinner?","review_id":"oZRbzMclFYWRIUQWkK1lbQ","stars":5,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":15,"useful":19,"user_id":"jipgimnSNp3qdK2dKUQvBg","date":"2011-06-20"},{"cool":0,"text":"I was so disappointed with this buffet.

The Wicked Spoon will make you rethink what you thought about buffets. This is as close as a buffet can get to fine dining. \n\nThe dishes here are served on small plates instead of in vats like old school buffets. Everything is fresh and served at a proper temperature. The dishes themselves are really creative with interesting flavor combinations. They have all types of food from Italian to Asian to breakfast foods to creative salads to desserts. Both times I have been there they had a signature juice blend that was tasty. \n\nSome advantages I find to Wicked Spoon over Baachanal are the location, wait times and seating arrangement. Wicked Spoon is on an upper floor at the end of a hall making it a bit more hidden and less crowded whereas Baachanal is near the pool lending itself to crowds and longer wait times. Wicked Spoon's seating is better because you can see the entire food area from every seat, the walk to the buffet is shorter and the seats aren't packed together as much making it easier to walk. The weekend brunch is the best bang for your buck too.","review_id":"gMv1tdDj1pG3pcEnL8x4Fg","stars":5,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w","date":"2015-07-06"},{"cool":4,"text":"Even though it is located in one of the nicest hotels in Vegas, this buffet doesnt live up to its name and reputation.

First off, $27 for dinner is about $10 less than other hotels such as Bellagio and Wynn.  Yes this buffet may not have sashimi or lot of seafood such as crab leg, this hotel has variety, innovation, and something different.  They have the traditional salad and meat stations but they have other new offerings that other buffets don't have such as...bone marrow, pork belly bun, pork belly fried rice, dashi broth, truffle potato gratin, smelt fries, tiny ice cream cones, and much more.  The presentations of each dish were very well done.  Some dishes had their own little pot or own little plate however this did become an issue when it was time to put food on your plate (spacing).  The desserts were a bit weak even though the colors made it very tempting.  For example, macaron's quality/texture was what made it bad.  The shell was too crunchy where if you put some force on it, it would just crumble.  \n\nThe service and decor were both great.

Very bright in colors and taste! I could eat a full plate of the Kale Salad and be so happy :) http://su.pr/1lzRQB\n\nThe Green Papaya Salad was perfectly al dente in texture and mixed with green beans, green onion, tomatoes, and peanuts. The dressing had a hint of sweet and a bit tart which marinaded well with all the ingredients. I even opted to add tofu to soak up some of that delicious flavor. http://su.pr/3imgLq\n\nThe Sweet Potato Pur√©e was like candy! Smooth and vanilla-y, I definitely went back for seconds on this one. http://su.pr/2qgxuv\n\nThe only less than great items were the avocado rolls and the veggie rolls offered at the sushi area.

The Mango Sorbet and Raspberry Sorbet were super delicious! http://su.pr/2C6VL6\n\nDuring our dinner visit, many of the lunch items were still available but I was happy to see that they added more vegan friendly things including:\n- A garbanzo bean, tomato, and cucumber salad\n- An Israeli couscous salad\n- An artichoke and hearts of palm salad\n- Hummus, baba ganush, and pita chips\nhttp://su.pr/290Jjf\n\nAll items were good but I might note that the hummus and baba ganush was a bit on the thin side.

Gambling was on the minus side, but fortunately I think the food we tried on our latest Vegas trip was on the plus side.\n\nFirst off, the new Cosmopolitan hotel is absolutely gorgeous and stunning. Unlike the commercials, you won't see random cute animals running about with catchy music in the background, but if you appreciate abstract art, you'll feel right at home. Much of the chic decor has definitely influenced their buffet. \n\nIt's probably one of the most beautifully decorated buffets I've ever seen. This is from somebody who grew up on Circus Circus buffets as a kid. We've come a long way (shed tear). We came for dinner around 5pm on a Friday night and while there was a small line, it went by pretty fast. Soon enough, we were seated at our table.\n\nAs you may of heard or read, they do things a little differently here. Some of their dishes are served in small porcelain cups and trays, or stainless steel pots and miniature pans. I think it's a great idea to keep the freshness and integrity of the food -- such as the braised beef short ribs. While a bit on the rich and salty side, I thought it was a dish that rivaled that of many high-end restaurants.\n\nOther favorites of mine include the prime rib, fish, and... wait for it, vegetables. Sometimes buffets go overboard with fancy dishes, but I like how this buffet executes their veggies -- like the green beans and brussel sprouts (gasp). The dessert station was fantastic. I liked the stacked squares of fudge and various mini cakes and tarts. My favorite was the gelato station, where you can tell that it was good quality.\n\nBut it wasn't without some misses, however. The supposed \"crab\" dish was pretty disgusting. Rubbery and chewy, pale-looking masses of meat, I'm not quite sure what type of crab this was from -- maybe some mutant crab that lived in the depths of the sea. The meat was taken out of its shell and sauteed in a sauce. No matter, it was bland anyway. \n\nYou won't find any of the long, dangling king crab legs that you're used to seeing in other Vegas buffets. They have mini pre-shelled crab claws served in small trays that come with a dab of cocktail sauce and wedge of lemon. It's okay, but you might need a few dozen of these just to get your crab fix. \n\nIn the end, I was pretty satisfied that I got my $27 worth for dinner. Service was excellent, and I like how they leave a bottle of cold water at your table so you don't have to keep asking for it.

Of course, the unlimited Perrier Jou√´t champagne might still have be going back to Sterling. \n\nI truly adores you for the reasons below.\n\n- Good selection of food from a wild range of cuisine and origins. You can find anything from fried chicken, pizza, curry to Korean bbq, dim sum, sushi and many more.\n\n- Excellent quality control and presentation. Most dishes are served in lovely individual containers. They looks neat and you don't have to worry about anyone leaving a mess at the buffet tables. \n\n- Tasty food! While I can't say I love every single dishes I have tried, there are quite a few things that stood out. The kalbi was great. Salmon was seared quite nicely. The fried chicken was very crispy and the egg Benedict wasn't half bad. I really enjoyed the salad bar too. They have good quality heirloom tomatoes and olives.\n\n- The Dessert. That is THE reason why you need to come here. I used to like Bellagio's desserts but Wicked Spoon beats them in all aspects. These goodies look (and taste) better than those from pastry shops. I think it is a bargain even if you just come here for the desserts. Must try their caramel walnut tart, flourless chocolate cake and apple pastry. The gelato station is skippable. \n\nWhat makes it even better? Brunch buffet comes with a glass of champagne/mimosa/bloody mary. \n\nI will return for their dinner buffet.

Decor inside is just as cool as the casino itself. The meat section however wasn't the buffet's strong point. Prime rib lacked flavor and nobody wanted to get the cured bacon. Salad/fruit bar was awesome! Love how everything was fresh and they even had blood oranges! Bad thing was that their shrimp cocktail was served in these tiny cups w/ just about 2 pieces of shrimp in it and a tiny thing slice of lemon. Had the standard breakfast foods as well and omlette section. Their chef could use some customer service lessons. They don't really interact w/ you and give off a vibe that they hate their job.\n\nMost of the food here was the same as any other buffet quality wise, but what differentiates this buffet from the Wynn is the dessert section!

Although, I did enjoy the Bangers n' Mash which seemed to a be a popular dish among our table. The dish was pretty much mashed potatoes with gravy and spicy sausage. It seems like such a simple dish but it was flavorful. I had about three of these! The dessert and aqua fresca (watermelon juice) was probably the second and third best things I've had during brunch. I really wish there was more options available so I'll probably come back again for late lunch/early dinner. The brunch price doesn't justify the option of food they had set out.","review_id":"o8ouWWW7NkOggO7BBrrqcw","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":3,"useful":4,"user_id":"AOsb45lNP7AzQwwWLUQxEg","date":"2013-07-09"},{"cool":0,"text":"I've been living in Vegas for 3 years and finally got around to eating here. Buffets are never worth the price for me because I'm a grazer when it comes to food and I never get my money's worth. But I saw it on Food Network recently and thought I really need to make it over. I had some friends in town and it seemed like a good time to drag my ass to the damn strip and try it out with them.\n\nFirst, the line kind of sucked. Which I expected. It was a Saturday around noon so I expected to wait. My impatient friends bitched and complained. Small town people have no idea that waiting 45-60 mins at a popular restaurant, on a Saturday afternoon, in a big city, is not uncommon. Their griping probably worked my nerves more than the wait itself. \n\nWe finally get in and the spread was great. SO much to choose from. I absolutely love how everything is served in small portions. It helps one control themselves when you would really like to try as much as you can. I wanted to try everything. I couldn't try everything. I don't think I even tried half. But I didn't try a bad thing. I had some favorites... The salmon, smoothie, bread pudding to name a few. But everything was really good. I didn't see crab legs though. Which I thought they had. \n\nI don't see myself going on a weekend ever again. I'm not one for crowds. But I'd definitely go back when I know it wouldn't be too packed. They have a good selection of food and the presentation is nice. I still don't feel I got my money's worth. My stomach is just not that big (sob).

I had gotten no more than 5 hours of sleep over the course of 48 hours (combination of work, partying, gambling, and attending a conference).  After Monday's seminar headed back to my room at the Palazzo and decided to find some food.  I wanted to dine at L'Atelier but my buddy isn't a huge fan of French and wanted to dine at a casual restaurant.  We couldn't come to a conclusion as to where to go so I threw out Wicked Spoon.  \n\nValet'ed the car and proceeded to look for the buffet.  There are some signs that point you in the general direction but of course we got lost.  Ended up asking the security guard where the place was and we were told to back track and head up the escalator (they need to have more signs for new visitors).  Was surprised to find the place fairly empty (perhaps it was due to the fact that it was a Monday and we were eating at around 6:30).  \n\nI was told by various cab drivers that the food quality is just so so but they really do spend time on the presentation of all their dishes.\n\nTried various dishes and found some that I liked and others that were just average.  My complaints for the night were with a few of the desserts and also with their roast beef/prime rib.  The beef served was tougher than what I'd find at Norm's and had virtually no taste at all.  I did fall in love with their bean sprout dish (seasoned with seasame oil, vinegar, and soy sauce..i think).  Their gelato/ice creams were average but they had these huge chocolate covered strawberries.  \n\nServie was ok and noticed our waiter only taking away 2-3 plates at a time...homie needs a bigger tray or hire more people to help clear the tables.  There were several times where we had stacks of plates just sitting in front of us while the server just casually walked around carrying drinks or just 1-2 dishes on his tray.  As others have stated, this buffet is very affordable at $35/ person.

Yes, the portions were controlled and done in small batches which insures that they are constantly cooking and replenishing from fresh.  No hidden back kitchen where an army of people make a big serving tray full of food.  Here, I saw them cook my food and plate it under the heating lamp.  I almost didn't even want to take anything that wasn't just freshly cooked!  If one is lucky enough, a person can just wait for fresh hot food to come out almost every time.\n\nThings that I did miss were the staples of Vegas buffets: large king crab legs, some sashimi options, and maybe a chocolate fountain?  I almost expected them to have a fountain of chocolate since it is the buffet of the Cosmopolitan? But eh, oh well.  \n\nFor $35 for dinner, would I come back?

After all the raving I'd heard about this buffet and a family member's recommendation...I decided to make my way with my mom to try out this buffet. My naivety made me think that the Cosmo, being a proponent for the alternative lifestyle would cater somewhat to a vegetarian. So I paid ~$28 per person for a brunch buffet. \n\nLet me preface the rest of this review by saying that if I only had 2 dishes to sample and they were of excellent quality...I'd keep my mouth shut. I had a large number of dishes to sample...none of them inventive, none of them delicious and none of them memorable in any way. The salads were bleh...there was a greek salad, kale salad, oven-dried tomatoes, caprese and beet salad. ALL of which did not entice seconds (considering I couldn't even palate the one tablespoon of each salad I took). The angry mac and cheese was shells, velvet and some hot sauce. Although purportedly vegetarian, I spied a few bowls of them with bacon bits. Not cool.\n\nThere was the usual Italian fare...gnocchi with a basil tomato and black garlic sauce (average), sweet pea risotto (horrible) and cheese pizza (how uninteresting). The Asian section had chicken powder/stock in everything. I was told by one chef that the udon was vegetarian...then another one said, no it was not. I gave up and didn't even try it. I asked if they could make me a simple vegetable roll with soy paper but low and behold...the sushi they get is prepackaged and bought from some conglomerate like Sysco. Cosmo...weren't you supposed to be different and awe-inspiring?\n\nThe bread offered was BAGELS (like two types) and there were three types of sad cheeses on the charcuterie. Pathetic. The only thing I had with some glee was the red velvet pancake.The chocolate covered strawberries was a nice touch but the rest of the desserts not too good. They do have a pretty legit gelato bar if that's your scene. \n\nI had about $5 worth of food.

The buffet was slow so we had almost no line or wait to pay or to be seated. I would say that was a plus especially since we came at peak buffet crowd time (600ish). \nOur server for the evening was endearing and cordial however you could tell that he was stressed and slammed due to large section he had. He came by the check on us a few times but always at the wrong times. We had to hunt him down to request refills. He seemed to migrate toward another table of fellow employees to chat. Not professional my friend! \n\nAs mentioned earlier there was no crowd when we arrived so there was minimal waiting the bad side to this is that the food on the buffet line does not move as fast; ergo more time for the food to get a suntan under the heat lamps. \nThis was the case for about 75% of the hot food I tried. As a restaurant. kitchen manager you need to be aware of how many patrons are in the facility. Yes, the food was made from quality ingredients but that all goes to waste when you bite into it and its luke warm or has already coagulated. \nGranted some stations were better than other. The kalbi was constantly being filled up and was nice and fresh on all 3 of my dinner plates (don't judge). \n\nThe Asian section was pretty dismal. There were only 3 types of sushi available; California roll, spider roll and salmon nigiri. Only 1 type of hot chinese dish; prok riblets and only one dim sum dish; har gow (shrimp dumplings)\n\nThe Italian food section was always stocked of food but all of it was old. I grabbed a prime rib panini from the back of the plate on my first trip and blech! It was soggy and cold... \n\nThe same can be said about the braised short rib, wicked fried chicken, shepherds pie, bone marrow, har gow (shrimp dumplings and wild boar sliders. I grabbed the freshest looking ones and they were all luke warm and old. It's very sad because all of the food seemed to be made of high caliber ingredients and were very decadent and rich but were not edible because of temperature. \n\n\nIf you have been to any of the lesser buffets (downtown or the 7.99 dinner buffets) you know the key to getting good food is waiting for the fresh dishes to pop out of the kitchen. This was the case on this buffet adventure. \n\nOn my first trip on the line I kept circling the carving station waiting for a new prime rib to show up. The carver had this teeny tiny piece of prime rib jerky that he was trying to get rid of before he pulled another roast. I feel sorry for whoever got that piece of meat! Eventually he brought out another roast and myself and the other sharked pounced on it. \n\nOn the second trip I saw that they were plating a dish in the prep area so I waited and lo and behold they were carnitas! Lucky me! I also noticed anew batch shepards pie being pushed out on the line. Blah! This was bootleg sheperds pie. It looked like they grabbed some meat and thew some of the mashed potatoes from the buffet bin on it. There was no char or baked top like the first batch I saw. Shame on you for trying to pull a fast one!\n\n\nThe only station that was awesome through and through was the desert station! All of the items I tried were outstanding! Even the raspberry rice crispy treat was on point. If it was not for the desert section being so awesome I think that I would've given this place a 2* rating... \n\n\nI like the tapa's concept and prie fix portions. I just am not a fan of the management of the food line. I am sure that if you come on a Saturday night when is packed and the food is moving that it is much improved. With that more care and consideration need to be taken into consideration when putting out the product. As mentioned earlier a good portion of the food I tried was I would expect this at a Station casino buffet but not at a high profile buffet like here. \nIn my opinion pay the $5 more dollars and go to the bacchanal buffet at Caesars Palace.

Were they the best ones I've had?  No but they were decent and had a molten center, which is pretty damn impressive for a buffet.  My biggest gripe about buffets is that they prioritize quantity over quality and the food is usually lukewarm and congealed.  The awesome thing about Wicked Spoon is that many foods are served in individual ramekins, and not big bins, which keeps them fresher and more like non-buffet foods.  Even the bins (e.g. Scrambled eggs) taste much better than you typically find at a buffet.  Nothing we tried was bad and much of it was really excellent.

The cut fruit was good but come on, it's just cheap fruit...pineapple with lihing powder and some other stuff.\n\nThe only thing worth any hype at all is the French beignets with chocolate syrup (I must've filled up on like 10 of these, since nothing else was that good) and the desserts and gelato. But no creme brulee?\n\nI think I'll stick with the Paris and Rio buffets. To all you people who gave this a good rating, were you drunk?

However, the food quality itself and customer service still have lots areas that needs to be improved.\n\n1. Whoever directed us to cashiers needs to know when her fellow coworkers are going on lunch break. When you direct customers to a queue, you better know your cashier is not closing down the counter for her own break, or the result is the angry customers redirected line to another cashier while waiting behind the people whose originally behind you in line.\n\n2. Waiter/Customer ratio.  I feel bad for the staffs that work here. They have to carry alot of the heavy plates and I did witness some girl dropped the glass bottles (bye bye to part of her wage?).  I agree with other posters that we hardly get our plates removed.  It is easier to push our plates onto other people's table when they are gone than waiting for our waiter to remove them.   Our waiter forgot to bring some of our drinks during the first round, and we had to ask others to refill our drink because we just don't see him very often.  However, when we can grab someone to help, they were glad to help.\n\n3. Food availability.  I know this place is trying to be different.  They cut lunch at 3pm.  But the food seems to be disappear starting from 2:15pm.   They have a set quota of food that would be offered during lunch hours.  After the amount of food that's consumed., then it is gone.  For example, sushi (Cut rolls, hand rolls), crab cocktails were gone around early 2pm.  You just simply can't find the chef working at the sushi station no more after 2:15pm.  They just remove the plate completely.  The lady works at the crab stations were trying to find some crabs for me, but there's simply no more. (Yes this is a buffet but you are telling me, sorry, no more food - What a JOKE).  If you guys have set quota of food available, you should be better off a la carte instead of buffet.\n\n4. Food taste - Everything tastes very, very average, nothing Wowed me.  It is one of those places that you go in, you come out, and you don't remember what is good about it.   By the way, their Asian Station is bad, I highly recommend them to improve the taste of the food that they offer and they need to clean the counter more frequently.  I have seem that slice of Korean BBQ beef been hanging on the counter (instead of the plate/bowl where its suppose to belong) during the duration of my visit.\n\n5. Dessert tastes alright. Small dishes concept, their chocolate dipped strawberry are the highlight of the entire buffet.  Everything else tastes pretty average at best.\n\nSince this place is still NEW (opened less than 2 weeks). I give a 3* rating instead of the 1-2 star rating and as I would.  However, until further improvements have been made on service and food, I do not recommend nor I will go back to this buffet for the price and the \"Super luxury\" buffet that they claimed themselve to be.","review_id":"u1KCHGN_ggis9tBCUUTyBw","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":2,"useful":3,"user_id":"O8M-LETl8rMBPwr9E8HxXg","date":"2010-12-29"},{"cool":0,"text":"maybe you should change this to wicked spoon desserts.  i'll give it 4 stars, but that's only going to your amazing dessert selection.  the rest of the food = 3, given that i attended for brunch.\n\nyes, the chocolate dipped strawberries.  eat them.  they are so plump and juicy.  i still don't know why these are an aphrodisiac.  i wasn't getting hot in my pants.  i really just enjoyed eating strawberries and chocolate (with peanuts and toffee) together because the combo is delicious.  the whipped cream to make strawberry shortcake, too, was so nice and fluffy. \n\nthere were so many desserts, that yes, this place has the best selection desserts. i think i had stumbled upon a good mango macaroon.  or orange. but it was orange colored and did not taste like my mimosa. like i said, macaroon revolution 2011.\n\nthough i had only went for brunch and was pressured by my significant other that it's a must try - yes, it's been tried and done.  unfortunately there was not one single dish that stood out to me.  i think this is a rarity where the reputation of desserts overpower the rest of the food. you know, it's  the usual asian, southern style, prime rib, mac'n'cheese, salad bar, breakfast ish, yeah. eh. ok. like hometown buffet. i do love the little pots though , and the bottle of water ready on the tables.\n\nwill i come again? sure.  i'll come back for some strawberries and whipped cream.","review_id":"Wb0CQijcw7VjhSnI8LYgpg","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"9y5NZGmt8fzE7AqEDuNhFg","date":"2011-07-03"},{"cool":1,"text":"I'm not a big fan of buffets, and have never had a good experience at one until I went to Wicked Spoon.

I might almost like the brunch menu better.\n\nBrunch has an omelette bar instead of the shrimp/mussel station.  The granola was actually my favorite part of the buffet.  Sounds weird but it tasted freshly made and not stale at all.  It went well on the oatmeal with some brown sugar.  I am a fiend for oatmeals.  They also served grits which is pretty cool.  The dessert is pretty much the same as dinner.  Chocolate covered strawberries are always the best for me along with some gelato.\n\nDinner menu has the shrimp/mussel bar that I mentioned earlier.  You get to choose which kind of butter you want your seafood cooked in.  Drool!  The kalbi short ribs in the asian section are always a hit.  Once the tray is set down, people snatch them up like they are gold.  Prime rib is ok but not great.  Save room for the dessert and gelato bar too.

Really folks... the deal is not what it used to be and they are living on lost reputation... kinda like a chicken that is running around after its head is cut off. \n\nYes they have some intriguing and great items here. However when I was just here, not 1 person was impressed. When I see the prices that people used to pay of $22 for brunch/breakfast, I can agree my whole outlook would likely be different. However the price is not $39+tax & tip. So realistically you are looking at a $50 meal. Is this place worth that? To be BLUNTLY BRUTALLY HONEST, OHHH HELL NO! It's a standard Vegas buffet.\n\nThe Good: \nBangers n mash - Hands down the best tasting item on the menu. The sausage snapped when taking a bite. Even on a precut portion. The gravy was perfect. However the mash was one of the best, if not the best, that I may have ever had.\n\nStir Fry Beef - My second favorite item on the menu. But you can get the same results from just about any good Chinese restaurant for $10-15.\n\nWatermelon Juice - Super Tasty, but I cant remember what exactly that they called it\n\nKalbie Ribs - If you like strong flavors (perhaps over the top) this was an awesome thing to eat as well. There was no subtlety here it was in your face taste and I loved it.\n\nGelatto - Hit and miss, but the mint chip was outstanding and the best of the 5 flavors that I tried.\n\nCheesecake - very rich moist and extremely filling in small portions\n\nBACON! Just the right level of crispy and soft. Very flavorful, and tasted more how I make my bacon than I almost ever find at a restaurant.\n\nThe OK:\nPrime Rib au jus\nBlue cheese\nCream corn with red n green peppers\nMost of the deserts\n\nThe unimpressive:\nAngry mac n cheese - bad day? The cheese wasn't creamy and seemed to be separating, very oily\nLinked sausage from the carving station - no snapping, no taste, no interest\nFried Chicken - no taste hardly at all. The Colonel 's chicken is ten billion times better than this. (several of the yelpers I was eating with agreed that this is the worst that they have tasted chicken from wicked spoon)\nGnocchi - very very bland with an unanticipated consistency, almost grainy if that makes sense. Definitely different from when I have had this in the past\nThe asian riblets - very weird tasting and I only took a small niblet to figure that one out\n\nThe five billion little dishes for food to come in. This is an utter nightmare. I do like that all the dishes can be tasted separately, but it's still a royal pain in the derri√®re!  This is easily solved by plates with dividers on them as an option... it is a buffet err cafeteria after all. Ohhh wait, does it matter? They ran out of all of these lil pint size dishes and started putting out large bowls for things previously in mini dishes.\n\nThe service sucked. I had to ask for more juice several times and they didn't want to take the dirty dishes even though we had piles of mini bowls, baskets, plates, etc... Then when they did take plates from us, they just grabbed everything from you including what you may still have been working on.\n\nIn summation, for the money spent, this place is not worth it to go to again for me. Perhaps it was a bad day. At least I didn't wait in line for this crap like so many others were doing. Drop the price, kills the stupid excess dishes, improve service, make sure you don't have an off day in the kitchen, and I bet I may like it. I would have been satisfied in the $20 range. But at a base price of double that, it simply does not even remotely contemplate being a good deal...\n\nOne last thing, being it was brunch, if you wanted champagne, mimosa's, or alcohol period, that was an additional fee.

The hostess escorted us to our seats and let us know we could get started. \n\nI recommend circling the buffet before filling the plate. There is so much to choose from; salads, carved meats, pastas, Chinese, Japanese, breakfast items and mucho desserts and sweets. \n\nDuring my visit I tried the carved chicken breast it was very good, moist and juicy. Green mixed salad, beet salad with feta and cucumber salad. All were fresh and taste good. Shrimp was served in a small clear plastic cup with the red cocktail sauce. It was okay not much flavor the sauce helped. The Mac n cheese was served in small metal pot. It was very cute but taste was just okay. It was a little runny but the bread crumb topping was delish. The smoked salmon was very good . It was served on a small platter with capers and cucumbers. I tried a few pieces of spicy tuna and california rolls. They were okay not much to remember. \n\nNow for the important stuff DESSERT!! \nI had two of the huge chocolate covered strawberries. OMG so good they were topped with Oreo cookie crumbles. I could have eaten until I got myself sick off of them. Next dessert victim was a cake pop. It was chocolate cake with a dark chocolate hard outside covered with gold flakes. A small bite was enough it was so rich. I stole a small bite of the apple crumble served in a small metal pot. It was okay nothing special. \n\nService was not good. The waiter was MIA  95% of the time. He checked on us once. Then he took our water carafe, napkins and silverware when we went up for the last trip and never replaced it. I don't think he cared to checked to see if we came back. \n\nWe normally tip when we are dining at buffets but needless to say we didn't this time. \n\nI wouldn't let the bad service stop us from coming back. The food was good for a buffet, price is fair and the buffet line was clean. I like how most of the items are portioned out in small bowls and containers.","review_id":"FvQF-WmUhewMvSzRgr7N3A","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":1,"useful":4,"user_id":"l2uNHbNrt6dmW7PNklJRdg","date":"2012-07-06"},{"cool":0,"text":"LOVED!  LOVED!!  LOVED THIS PLACE!!!\n\nI found this place through Yelp and really looked forward to eating there on my trip!  My BF and I spent a week in Vegas; and on our 2nd to last night there, we finally ate at the Wicked Spoon Buffet!!  First of all, it's in the Cosmopolitan Resort & Casino - which is a very beautiful hotel, but bigger than it seems!  It was a journey to get to, but at least there were lots of art work to look at and take pictures of!  I especially loved the larger than life stilettos and the pictures of chocolate dipped objects: more stilettos and sunglasses...so hot!  \n\nWe got there a little after they opened for dinner (5pm) and there was no wait.  We were walked to our table which wasn't in a really \"pretty\" area of the buffet, but very close to all the food!\n\nOn my first trip to the buffet, I got some salads, gazpacho, shrimp w/risotto, and some kind of fish on top of asparagus.  Everything was good, but the fish was not that good - my BF grabbed a different type of fish dish that tasted better!  For my next trip, I got some sushi, prawns, kalbi, beef with gnocchi, a kind of noodle soup thing I mistook for pho, and sauteed string beans with brussel sprouts, caramelized onions, and garlic.  The kalbi and soup were not so good, but the veggies were sooo good!!  So was the gnocchi and sushi!  My BF got some crab legs and gave me some meat (I really HATE cracking open crab legs - if they aren't King Crab Legs...not worth the work!), so that was good, since I didn't have to crack them myself.\n\nThe dessert section of the buffet was as overwhelming as the regular food section - there was soo much to choose from!  And everything was so beautifully displayed!  The colors on the mini treats were very vibrant and I could hardly make up my mind!  There were even about 20 different flavors of ice cream!  There was Peanut Butter & Jelly, Pistachio, Caramel Candy Bar, etc.  Soooo good!!\n\nI really liked this buffet, it's pretty and the food is really good.  Service was especially good - our water was always filled by our waiter, even though they have a big glass water bottle thing at the table - so we could've filled it ourselves!  Our plates were always taken away in a timely manner, and whenever we needed anything - our waiter was there!  Plus, it's in a super swank hotel that makes you feel like you're a high roller!","review_id":"z-tHvkjyUWqN_81DvZRTRA","stars":5,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"xkmwzqyy4ZSMsEIejwq41w","date":"2011-10-18"},{"cool":0,"text":"Wow what an amazing experience.

The entrees however missed several notes:\n\n- Many of the dishes were way over seasoned this time: Korean Galbi, mushroom risotto, and cocktail shrimp.\n\n- The roasted pork belly was cut into huge chunks, like a ball of pure fat.  It's supposed to be a layer of meat, fat, and crispy skin, but here it was nearly all fat!\n\n- Sushi options were limited, and the snapper nigiri had cold, hard rice.\n\nThere were a few bright spots: octopus salad was tender and had good acidity, kale salad and collard greens were good, and the lamb and prime rib were both juicy and flavorful.\n\nWe may need to take a break from Wicked Spoon to try out a few other places.

I went for Saturday brunch with a group of friends. First, Wicked Spoon is in the farthest reaches of the Cosmo, on the 2nd floor.  I guess they want you to work up an appetite by walking to the buffet.  We were pleasantly surprised that the line wasn't that long when we walked up at 12p, but they do pull a bit of a bait and switch on you- one quick line for payment, and one LONG line to wait for your table.  Gotcha!!  Luckily, we combined with a few other people to form a party of 8, and they seated us right away, just with a 18% automatic gratuity.\n\nThe buffet set up is great, and the surroundings beautiful.  Bottles of water are already set up on your table, so you don't have to wait for a drink if you need one before the waitress takes your beverage order. I did not care for my OJ (too watery), but that's a minor complaint.  Let's get to the food!!  \n\nThere were so many options... Really too many to name.  My favorite dishes were the French Toast (thick Texas toast, great batter), the eggs with cheese, the Wicked Chicken, the shrimp cocktail, the mashed potatoes (very creamy), and the gnochi.  The carving stations were very good as well. The raved about Angry Mac & Cheese was just so-so (no real kick to it, although it was creamy), the desserts were cute and tasty, but nothing to write home about, and the Korean ribs were extremely fatty.  I was very disappointed with the seafood selection too- it was minimal, at best. \n\nAs far as the cute little individual serving sized dishes and pots and what have you, I'm not really a fan. I understand that it keeps everything separate and clean and portion controlled, but dammit, if I'm at a buffet, I WANT to be a glutton.  Those little dishes are hard to carry and take up a lot of room on your plate. I suppose that's the point, in WS's eyes, but it got to be really annoying. I generally want more than 2 shrimp, so having a little container with a shrimp cocktail with just 2 shrimp in it got on my nerves.  \n\nService was pretty decent, friendly and efficient.

It was my lady's barfday so she chose to try out this buffet.\n\nWe got in about 5:00 p.m. which is right around their opening time following a brief closure following the lunch rush.  The line was already stacking up, but it moved pretty quickly.\n\nLuckily, there are a lot of interesting artsyness scattered around the area, some provocative architecture that is fun for the eyeballs.  Great for Instgramers and social geeks alike.\n\nOnce in, the selection is limited, although, it seems as though the Wicked Spoon prides it self on offering unique portions of different tastes and flavors.  Not your typical gluttony smorgasbord, but instead more of a collage of interesting grinds.\n\nSome of the exquisite dishes include beef tongue shepperd's pie, duck ravioli, mac and cheese customization station, and some sort of bone marrow dish that is all the rave.  Unfortunately, the Xmas rush depleted all of it before our visit.  I guess that means a future date is in the plans.  And for those that expected a typical buffet, there is an excellent salad and desert bar and of course, snow crab legs galore.  The good thing is that they pre laser slice the crab legs in half for convenience and if you ask me, a great way to ration without bursting your stomach lining or wasting food.\n\nI still think that the M buffet is the best in town and strikingly similar to Wicked Spoon excepts with much more to offer.  There is unlimited wine for $9 bones, but no unlimited beer or espresso, boo!\n\nStill a must to try out just for the unique dishes they offer, but beware, it is a bit pricy for what you get.

There's your breakfast choices such as pancakes, eggs benedict, omelette station, fruits and salad bar, etc. As for the entrees, there's the angry mac 'n cheese, artisan sausage, prime rib, bone marrow, seafood pasta, polenta, etc. Some memorable dishes would have to be the seafood pasta.\n\nA plus about this place is how they come in serving sizes such as in either small plates or cute little cups. They come in the right size sample so that you can try a little bit of everything!\n\nBesides the entrees, there's a juice bar! There's mango juice as well as grapefruit banana juice (my favorite!) In addition, there's cheeses, salad, as well as smoked salmon (I highly recommend!)\n\nAs for the desserts, there's two kinds of chocolate-dipped strawberries (with peanuts or with Oreos).

The interior design matches the rest of the casino -- modern, chic, and sophisticated. The food has that same style. This definitely ain't your grandma's buffet.\n\nUnlike many buffets in town the food isn't presented in huge troughs that you dig into to serve yourself. Here everything comes pre-plated for individual servings. Although they do have several carving stations scattered about. The food that is pre-plated is served on small square plates, or small pots and pans that make it all look more upscale than your typical buffet.\n\nNot only does the food look good, much of it tastes good. Here are some of the hits and misses.\n\nHITS\n- Steak w/ chimichurri sauce: tender strips of meat cooked to about medium or medium rare. Delicious\n- Huevos rancheros: a single, lightly fried tortilla folded in half and filled with ground beef (I think?) with a fried egg on top. Tasty.\n- French toast: stuffed with cinnamon apples and walnuts. mmmm.\n- Short rib pasta: small chunks of boneless beef short rib with pasta and mushrooms. One of the best dishes of the day (along with the steak).\n- Kalbi beef: savory, sweet and delicious\n- Mashed potatoes: creamy, rich and buttery\n- Fried shrimp balls: not the best, but not bad\n- Mussels: like the shrimp balls, not bad, but not great. \n- Desserts: there were plenty of desserts but I only grabbed a few to taste. Among the standouts were a pecan tart, key lime tart, chocolate covered strawberries, and gelato. The tiramisu wasn't bad. They all looked spectacular and many were topped off with what looked like gold leaf, which was a nice touch.\n\nMISSES\n- Risotto: one bite was enough for me. Funky taste and too mushy\n- Sushi: I've never had good sushi at a buffet. I don't know why I ever bother. There was a California roll and a spicy tuna roll that were average at best.\n- Desserts: not all desserts were good. I tried some sort of chocolate tart which was dry and bland and there was some sort of parfait-looking thing with chocolate, raspberries, and some sort of crunchy stuff that tasted off.\n\nThere were plenty of other dishes that looked good but i just didn't have room to eat any more. The individual chicken pot pies looked good, as did the shrimp, stuffed pork loin, mini sandwiches, and what looked like chili.\n\nThe biggest negative about the place was that there weren't any signs indicating what the food was. So, I had to ask the employees. All the employees were incredibly friendly -- from the cashiers to the waiters and buss boys to the kitchen staff. Everyone was eager to answer questions and were genuinely excited about the new hotel. Our waiter was probably a little too friendly, as he spent most of his time talking to people and very little time getting our drinks.\n\nI'm not sure how much the lunch prices or dinner prices are because we got there at 10:55 am and they charged us the breakfast price ($16 ea.). But, I'm sure it saved us a few dollars.\n\nWhile I still think the Bellagio and M Resort buffets are slightly better, Wicked Spoon isn't far behind. I do think it's better than other buffets I've been to (the Wynn, Red Rock, Palms, and Rio).","review_id":"nqPaKq2YxiH2NyMdlQ0NKA","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":3,"useful":6,"user_id":"C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w","date":"2010-12-18"},{"cool":0,"text":"I came here for brunch and had an overall good experience.

I liked the idea of portion controlled, individual dishes that you could pick up and take with you, however I didn't like anything that came in the dishes. I found the scrambled eggs to not be cooked enough and the traditional eggs benedict to be so hard that I couldn't cut through the english muffin.  Maybe they are still perfecting their dishes, but I noticed that everything that was prepared in a small individualized dish to not be good. \n\nEven though the dishes looked cute, I would rather have the food served in the traditional buffet style if it meant my food was actually cooked and tasted good.

The cashier was very patient with us as we sorted out our bill. Some had cards, while others had cash. Not once did she cringe or look put out. That was a good start. The weekend dinner was $35 dollars, add tax and the 18% gratuity for a large party, and it comes out to $45 per person. The service was quick and attentive, so the gratuity was deserved, but the food selection does not warrant the price. \n\nThe few specialty items such as the truffle potatoes, bone marrow, ratatouille, and lamb were delicious. Chinese food is like a salad bar, meant to fill you up and cost them nothing. I cannot help, but make a stop at this station when visiting a buffet. It pains me to say that the best dish offered at this station was the General Tsao Chicken. The kalbi was mediocre in flavor, but had a great charred crust. The consideration of removing the complete shell on the shrimp made for quick eating, but the cocktail sauce has no zest. The crab claws had a nice briny taste which I enjoy in seafood. The ceviche was good, but not spectacular. \n\nThe most disappointing part of the whole experience was the dessert island. They are all visually astonishing, but lacked in pleasurableness to the palate. The chocolate strawberries were plump and juicy, but the chocolate did not contribute anything to it. The salted peanut gelato was my favorite. The creamy streaks of caramel, vanilla base, and bits of salted peanuts reminded me of a Payday. The balance of flavors were exquisite. The pistachio, lemon, and mint were also delicious. Be careful of the lemon, because it is pucker inducing. \n\nOverall, you can do one of the other buffets for a fraction of the price and be satisfied.","review_id":"ZUi-Bm8N9Def1dG-_qoJYQ","stars":2,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":1,"useful":2,"user_id":"N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw","date":"2011-05-08"},{"cool":6,"text":"There are a lot of cool things about this buffet that no other place has but most of it was pretty average or subpar.

Crab stir fried in some kinda butter sauce might sound appetizing but I would rather just have a plate full of cold crab legs and crack them myself.  \n\nThey had the most lamb I'd ever seen in a Vegas buffet including ribs, leg and mini chops (prob my favorite thing in the whole place).  I also enjoyed the different individualized portions of pasta.  Wish I had more room for dessert.   \n\nAnd what's with the bottles of water they bring to the table?  There's a reason why every other buffet gives patrons those huge tumblers of water.  So the servers can deal with other stuff...like taking finished plates off the table.  Some of our plates sat there for a pretty long time before they got picked up.  We also had to repeatedly ask for more water and coffee before they actually brought it.  \n\nI can think of at least 5 buffets in town I would rather go to than this one for the price though.

Although the service was great, the just lacked flavor. I believe the biggest issue with this buffet is what makes it so appealing. The amount of food, and the array of different dishes were truly amazing. It honestly shocked me to think how much works must've gone into preparing each dish. My only issue with the items is that lack of flavor, and simply terrible seasoning mistakes.\nNone of the items had any sort of flavor unless the item spoke up for itself. The best thing they had out there was scalloped potatoes and their mashed potatoes next to the prime rib.\nThe prime rib was good, but it lacked salt. There was no crust on the prime rib. But it was tender and delicious. As far as other proteins go, they were just OK. The crab was okay, the shrimp was not good at all. I was happy that I just needed to pop them in my mouth. But then you actually bite down into the shrimp and it was just not good. It just tasted chewy, no shrimp flavor, nothing. It's comparable to the shrimp I've eaten at Station Casinos. \nThe Asian station OK. Orange chicken was a good dish. The TO-GO boxes were a nice touch. Then we moved onto the bruschetta. You bit into it and it was like your mouth was full of salt. What a mistake. I spit it out as soon as I bit into it. The desserts were all bland and not tasteful. It's hard to screw up chocolate covered strawberries. (Although, I just wanted plain ones and not ones covered in candy or graham cracker) The only thing that actually was good was the Gelato. IT was delicious! Along with the coffee. \nI think this buffet has its advantages with the amount of different dishes it serves.

Admittedly, those pictures were from over five years ago, but I did not expect the options to decline so steeply. \nForty-five minutes before closing, they were out of two different types of desserts. I saw a back up of one of them, but the employees wouldn't put it out for some reason? Aside from that, there were only three other types of desserts (one not being good), two flavors of below average-tasting macaroons, and basic flavors of average gelato. From the pictures, you would not guess that these were the only desserts. Either they slacked off the day we went, or they are always lacking in dessert options.\nOkay, onto the good: this buffet is currently the best I've been to. There is a great variety of options, and for the most part, food is changed out within minutes of it running out. \nAlthough I haven't been to many buffets in Vegas, it has definitely surpassed my expectations, based on the others I've been to.\nTypical buffet food is pretty bland and sticks to typical American foods, while this buffet has a little of a lot of different types of food.

I HAVE NEVER WAITED THAT LONG BEFORE *besides cheesecake factory in pasadena back in college, but we went planning to shop for an hour before going back.  we weren't cramped like sardines for that long like in the wicked spoon line.  would have been nice if we were offered water in line (they do that at the bellagio buffet line) *  we waited a total of 1.5+ hours finally be at our table.\n\n*NOTE: i called cosmo to ask about wicked spoon hours and whether we needed a reservation,etc.  the person told me, \"the wait will be about 5-10 minutes.  you don't need a reservation or anything.\" WOW...REALLY?!?!?  =O\n\ni like the concept of little dishes but for me, it was a MAJOR FAIL IN EXECUTION.\n\nfood selection was not as much as i expected.  they had some food in little cute dishes.  there was a line for the meat...rotisserie pork shoulder, lamb, prime rib.  i don't remember the last time i was this disappointed at quality/taste of prime rib.  the prime rib i had at flavors buffet in harrah's yesterday was several times better than wicked spoon's.  the pork shoulder was more flavorful than the prime rib.  after eating some prime rib that was overcooked, i spit it out cuz it was that bad.. *i did it carefully when no one was looking*  SAD...\n\nthe mac n' cheese bar is a novelty.  cool to pick your fixings and see the mac n' cheese made before your eyes.  the people who serve food are very nice (at the meats, mac n' cheese, etc). \n\ntruffled potatoes, creamed corn, beet salad, israeli couscous, asparagus were worth trying.  \n\ni tasted some of their asian food...omg, tasted like crap.  a lot of other food was either too salty or just plain bland.  \n\ncrab legs were good and cut in half so that you could easily get the meat out.  shrimp w/grits was okay.  fish was dry.  i rarely waste food.  pretty much whatever i get is what i eat.  but i had a lot of uneaten food on my plates..\n\ndessert..  there were two things i actually did like: pecan square tart and chocolate cake with caramel sauce on the bottom.  chocolate strawberries tasted good but they win the award (if there was one) of the sloppiest chocolate dipped oreo strawberries ever.\n\ni also asked for hot tea.  when the teapot arrive, the water was only lukewarm.  \n\ni don't care how fancy the place looks.  i'm the type of person who comes for the food.  don't charge me extra for your fancy decor.  I AM HERE FOR THE FOOD!!\n\nSO WHY 1 STAR???  *they don't even get 2 stars for one free buffet*\n\nHERE'S THE KICKER... hubby and i both had DIARRHEA 1.5 hours after consuming their buffet.  the food was not fresh.  it didn't look fresh...it didn't look appetizing...and sure you aren't supposed to judge a book by its cover, but one look and i knew (even though i still tried it to give it a chance).  \n\nso glad we didn't pay for 2 buffets.  not worth it.   i really should have stuck to my guns to go last year..  if you look at the pictures uploaded onto yelp, they are from last year.  definitely deteriorated in quality/taste??  when a buffet is newer, the place tries to impress the guests.  *i've found that bellagio is the most consistent after over a decade+..*\n\n*Note: we would have been better off going to Flavors Buffet @ Harrah's since it would have cost us $10 each with the coupon.  no long ridiculous misleading wait, no diarrhea, no wasting that much time.","review_id":"n2WWqcXLbcesJpkquYZUwg","stars":1,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":1,"useful":3,"user_id":"0qQI-n_ZfrwBewAgr1Nt8g","date":"2012-02-20"},{"cool":1,"text":"I read through some long reviews of this buffet prior to writing this, so I'll keep it short.

FYI (middle only secondary to the Sterling Brunch which is 100 a person, but essentially ranks with the other top 3 buffets in the city in terms of price range - Bellagio, Caesars, and Wynn.)\n\nWe came here on a Saturday evening at 6pm for dinner. It's located on the 2nd floor, closest to the \"East Elevators\" next to Rose, Rabbit, Lie. \n\nAs a party of 8, which was told by the cashier, due to the size of the party, there is an automatic 18% gratuity added, which totals $61.86 after tax and grat per person ($50 per person base price for dinner)\n\nThis isn't the first time I've been to Wickid Spoon but this may be my last. I had came here when it was still fairly new with my parents and wasn't too impressed with its quality or variety of food. It was much cheaper back then too at approx. $35 per person before tax and tips. \n\nWe were seated fairly quickly as soon as majority of the party had paid (1 person was late so we decided to be seated without her). We were seated in the back right corner, near the dessert section. We were pretty hungry so we left to grab food as soon as we got to the table and got our drink orders placed to the waiter. \n\nThe buffet consists of 6 sections. Salad, seafood, carving station, Italian, Chinese, and desserts. We had scoped the entire buffet (well we were seated at one end...) but essentially skipped almost the entirety of the salad section most of the dinner. \n\nThe buffet is mainly known for its unique presentation of most dishes, where they are mostly individually plated vs the huge platters and having their guests rummage through. \n\nThe seafood section was kind of tiny with an area of crab claws and legs, and a station which was still setting up, but later became a cook-to-order seafood scampi or seafood soup station. Both the claws and legs were bit hard to eat. Claws were a bit tiny. Shells were pretty broken so had to be careful in cleaning it enough to ingest. The legs were super overcooked and dried out. Quite unappetizing. Typically crab legs are one of my main items to eat at a buffet, usually getting a few plates FULL of legs. But in this case, I barely got half a plate. SUPER DISAPPOINTING ! \n\nCarving station/section had of course the carving station which consisted an area with pre-cut pieces of sausage, pork shoulder and something else, while the carving station had \"prime rib\", and leg of lamb. To the sides, the station consisted of some kale dish, fried frog leg, angry mac and cheese, Mexican corn, mashed potatoes, and some other things. Best things to mention was the angry mac and cheese, pork shoulder, leg of lamb. The \"angry mac and cheese\" was super heavy but very yummy. Thought it was going to be spicy because of the \"angry\" aspect but I guess it was maybe just a seasoned bread crumb topping. Lol. The pork shoulder and leg of lamb were both juicy and tender. I had tried the fried frog leg and Mexican corn, but they were not the best I've had. I think I prefer the usual way made in Chinese restaurants where its lightly deep fried with a salt/pepper/chili seasoning. The Mexican corn, as another friend had also thought as well, was missing the lime flavor. Wish they had some limes nearby (later found in the pho station at the end of the Chinese section). \n\nItalian section had a few pastas, some individually plated, some in a large bowl. We had found a similar theme throughout most of the pastas... Unfortunately, its not something positive. SALTY ! As good as the kale pesto pasta or the other pasta (not squid ink), they were both overly salty. I love pastas and typically hard for me to skip out on a good one, but man this was salty... They had pizzas and what not too but I hadn't tried any of them. I believe this section had the black mussels in a fennel sauce which was quite yummy. Probably best item of the section. \n\nChinese had the ever-popular bone marrow. For those who had not had bone marrow, its essentially \"fluid\" that runs in the middle of bones which, in the living, is a \"base\" cell that is multipotent to become different things. But in terms of food, its like a \"fatty\" like substance that people like to eat when the bone is split in half and roasted after seasoning, typically eaten with another \"supporting item\" like a toastette, bread, fries, etc. Decent but heavy. Being Chinese myself, this station, in most buffets, is what I usually don't touch. Typically not done very well and very Americanized. Besides the bone marrow, the other thing I had tried was the pho station. Bad choice. Soup tasted like a beef broth from the container. Broken non-typical pho rice noodles. Gross ! \n\nDesserts. Oreo and Heath bar topped chocolate dipped strawberries, mango dessert, salted peanut caramel ice cream with a warm brownie. Yum ! \n\nOverall, yeah still not good. Quite disappointed for price paid.","review_id":"Qs4WM-AhBjr2lRsLn8-B0A","stars":2,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":2,"useful":3,"user_id":"Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g","date":"2017-04-25"},{"cool":0,"text":"Ive been hearing a lot of hype about this place so of course I had to try it when I went to Vegas last week.

She got very excited, (which is mostly my goal when I see her..) as she had wanted to try this prolifically reviewed eatery out.  So, the plan of attack was for an early Christmas Eve dinner.\n\nI was not an overachiever in Boy Scouts but I do like to be somewhat prepared, especially when a VIP second person is involved.  I had called the day before to verify holiday hours.  The friendly receptionist at Cosmopolitan (there is no direct number to the restaurant which bothers me) assured me the hours were the same and there there was do difference in the weekend schedule.\n\nWe arrived to the cashiers desk approximately at 5:05pm based on the posted hours that they open at 5pm.  We quickly discovered approximately 75 people already in line.  In turns out that the holiday hours were in fact different - they had opened their doors at 4pm and not 5pm.  As I went to pay, the website indicated the weekend price per person was $35.  It was not.  It was $40.  Not a big deal, right?  I rarely visit the Las Vegas Strip because it is so painful to see how the corporate casinos will change policy at the last moment just to jack any and everyone that will put up with it.\n\nWe are seated in approximately one hour which is not too bad in the scheme of things.  I am not a buffet aficionado but I was armed and ready to compare my 3 prior experiences at the M Casino buffet.  I did not really like the layout of the Wicked Spoon.  The dessert bar was obviously very popular but for the  most part ALL of the other food stations were not that popular.  The sushi = blah, the salad bar = blah and pretty much everything was blah except the custom - to - order Mac & Cheese bar was novel and somewhat tasty.  The staff were friendly and professional.\n\nIn conclusion, to be honest, buffet's represent the worst American mindset.  Pay X-amount of money and just eat and eat and eat.  I work out regularly to stay in shape but also so I can enjoy certain foods.  But, dining at a buffet really contradicts a lifestyle I have chosen to live.  Secondarily, this restaurant represents a corporate machine (MGM) that basically has held our local economy hostage by their attitude of investor-group profits are first and foremost.  You can tell this by the entire City Center....Maybe if we throw 3 gillion dollars at something people will feel privileged to be there.  I personally make the choice to spend my hard-earned money at smaller, local establishments that appreciate my business.

Wicked Spoon is located in the Cosmo hotel and you will probably recognize this place because everyone loves taking photos in the life sized heels that are around the buffet.\n\nI came here for lunch and it was about $40 for lunch. It was a little cheaper than the Wynn buffet but if you want to go more all out, you can get bottomless mimosas for $9 more. I dont know why you would do that if you are already going to stuff yourself with allll those other items. Lunch closes at 3pm on the weekends and dinner starts at 5pm so you cant really linger so you can get the best of both worlds, unless you plan on staying for 4 hours at this place haha. The wait was longer than Wynn and it took us about 40 minutes to get to the front and finally sit down. It is beautiful inside as well and the chairs are comfy. I like the Wynn decorations better though.\n\nThe food is sooo delicious. There is so much variety but I really liked their tacos and their meat. I can describe all the food that they have but looking through photos will give you a better idea. I absolutely LOVEEEEE their dessert selection. They have so many desserts, cakes, macarons, GELATOOOO, tarts, chocolate covered strawberries, and sooo much more. Surprisingly my most favorite item was the yogurt and blueberries in a cup made out of chocolate. I can literally eat everything! I felt like Willy Wonka when he drank the tea and bit into the cup in the field of candy. I probably ate 5 of those. I ended up just asking if they can just give me blueberries and they were more than happy to give it to me. The desserts and food here are just so much better than Wynn and next time I go to vegas, I am just gonna head straight here :)\n\n**TIPS**\n1) Save room for dessert! The selection is wonderfully delicious!\n2) Food coma will hit you bad. Along with lack of sleep, the food coma knocked one of my friends out at the table.

For starters, I'm still full from Saturday's dinner here at Wicked Spoon.  I had eaten so much bone marrow, sans crostini because I'm a fattie, and dessert, I'm surprised I didn't throw up.  And this was before we hit the bar for some libations!  Matt C. was the best dinner companion for Wicked Spoon because he seemed to enjoy his food as much as I did.  I got to admit though that I thought there would be more variety.  \n\nThey had a carving station for pork shoulder and prime rib, duck a l'orange, homemade Italian sausage, a fish cooking station, a tiny selection of sushi, a pasta station, some pizza, an impressive salad bar, an even more impressive dessert bar, et cetera.  They even had crab legs!  Yet I still wanted more variety.  #LifeAsAFattie  Dinner was $50/pp and it was definitely busy.  I was disappointed that they were out of pork belly but having some mac & cheese made the disappointment a little better.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't mind stopping in again!

They did have one unique thing though.  They had Thai tea gelato.  That was pretty tasty.  \n\nSo, if these 3 dishes are enough to hold you, then by all means, stop by.

You are at the Cosmo. Expect it to be expensive and decadent. But then again, you are in Vegas at the City Center! What more could you ask for? AYCE Bone Marrow perhaps? Gelatto? Seafood? Fancy salads? Pappardelle? This place serves it up. I advise arriving right when they open so you can avoid waiting in line for hours.\nI like this place because it keeps my portions on check. As stated by Cathy C, they use the pre-plated method. This system enables you to try everything without feeling like your plate is covered with glop's of food. Great for a gobble monster like myself. I adore the salad section. Don't get me wrong, I love my proteins, but found myself going back to the greens. I feel like they use minimal salt so that you can season to taste. The chimichurri sauce at the carving station is pretty flavorful though. Fair warning! Your breath will not smell so heavenly after eating the chimichurri!\nI think what you have to keep in mind is that you're not only paying for the upper echelon of buffets. You are also paying for the experience. Your first point of contact is the hostess who rings up your bill and another hostess who takes you to your table- both accommodating, happy and super nice. Every waiter I've had goes above and beyond the norm. Now, if you would rather be left alone to eat in peace and rather not spend the $cA-chiNg$ for a higher end all you can eat....

Here are some highlights:\n\nOxtail pho - it's ok, doesn't have the full beef flavor that you would have in a Vietnamese restaurant.  Expect all of the fixings, basil, bean spouts, etc.\n\nSmoked salmon - pretty good quality, good smoky flavor and not too salty.  Paired with capers, it's a win.\n\nHomemade Italian sausage - yeah, I'm a sucker for this, although it's not an expensive item that you should stuff yourself with.\n\nCarved (mystery) beef - too tough, like beef jerky, but the flavor is there.  Suggest that you get only a small piece.\n\nRoasted port shoulder - add some chinese five spices, this would meet the meat shop standards in Chinatown.  Great when paired with BBQ sauce, very moist and tender.\n\nBroccoli rabe - amazingly, this is probably their best dish and it's not something that you see in much buffets.  Seasoned with a touch of butter and balanced with chili flakes, a must try and I went back for a second helping.\n\nVarious ice cream - be sure to save room in your tummy for this.

I liked the huge selection of food they had and really enjoyed the mac and cheese bar. There's a cook at the bar that makes your pasta on order. You just pick your pasta, cheese and toppings. They had a few concoctions like watermelon with a lime Sriracha sauce and a goat cheese panna cotta. I didn't care for either of them but I gave them credit for being so creative.

The main difference between the Wicked Spoon and other high-end buffets is the way they present the food. For the most part, each entree is prepared tapas style and served on a small plate or pan. You won't find the mountains of food on display like other buffets. Personally I liked this method and found that each entree was better prepared than at most other buffets where the entree is typically served in a large pan and you scoop up as much as you want.\n\nThe downside of this method is that the large plate that they give you is not an even multiple of the smaller plate which means that it's fairly awkward to put a few small plates on the larger plate. Also, at some of the stations the small plates sit on a warming plate and they can get a bit hot to pick up.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the first dinner that I ate here, especially at the bargain price of $40. The entrees were very well prepared and I was very impressed with the quality and variety. A very nice selection of up-scale dishes were available. The salads and desserts were plentiful and beautiful as well. What you won't find is ordinary dishes which was fine with me but might be a problem if you bring your kids and they're looking for fried chicken or other basic dishes.\n\nI liked the place to much that I returned the next day for brunch for $23 and many of the dinner items were also available but several breakfast items were added. The brunch entrees were not prepared as well as the dinner items were, IMHO. I almost passed on the pancakes and french toast after a couple of disappointing entrees but found them to be some of the best I've ever had.\n\nOverall they seem to prepare dishes with rich and robust flavors which I really like. They are certainly not the largest buffet in Vegas but one of the best if you're more into quality than quantity. Worth a visit if you're looking for something different. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","review_id":"jodF10h8jnSMal69kidZqA","stars":5,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":4,"useful":10,"user_id":"TGl6Qqk1NUWo__YMqLAlgw","date":"2014-10-24"},{"cool":3,"text":"I came back to Wicked Spoon and I had a great meal.

What I wanted to update in this review about the Wicked Spoon experience is this:\n\nMy friend said it best when he said: \"Wicked Spoon is great because they try to be different with their entrees.  When they make it hit, then it's really a hit.  When they miss, then, unfortunately they miss big.   But there are enough hits to ensure that you have a great experience here\".    Take that advice....you wont love everything here.  As with any buffet...when you come here, sample everything to look for their truly exceptional gems.  There are several gems to be found and you should be able to leave happy.

This was the best buffet in Vegas!! We just came back from our 4th trip to Vegas, and you can't beat Wicked Spoon. We have been to practically every buffet there, and this one can't be beat. We found out about it from our fellow Yelpers! (thanks guys!) It was so good, we hit it 2x in our week there. First time, we went for dinner with friends of ours who are very picky, meat & potato people from Tx. (We're from Nyc, and eat everything! Lol). At first glance I wasn't sure they would like it because the dishes looked fancy and real creative. However, the buffet is BIG and there are many different foods for every pallet. Each station has a different type of food, and each portion comes in a little container that looks like a 1 cup measuring cup. Very cute. Also a good idea because then you won't take more than you can eat. They had a great salad/fruit/cheese area, a MAC AND CHEESE BAR where you customize your dish!!, Korean bbq section, (amazing!), chinese food (general tso's chicken was great!) pasta, prime rib, sushi, crab legs, etc. We had an amazing lamb/cavatelli dish that could not be beat. Unreal flavor. I had 2 servings of that. Crab legs are usually my favorite thing, but these were skinny and dry and not good. That was the only zonk in there! Service was fantastic. The atmosphere is that of an upscale NY restaurant, not a buffet. Wait staff is on top of it with re-filling your glasses and removing old plates asap. Very friendly. \nThen when you're done eating- there's the dessert bar!! OMG! Take a DINNER SIZE plate and run over to the dessert bar. Don't play games here. This is serious eating. What they don't have!!! Gelato (the biscotti flavor was the best gelato I've ever had! Tasted like Creme Brulee).  They had chocolate covered strawberries dipped in oreos, nuts, etc. -Then they had unreal-fresh baked chocolate chunk cookies, oatmeal raisin cookies, etc. Then the strawberry shortcake bar where you assemble your own with fresh cream!!! Then there are pastries, tiramasu, creme brulee, chocolates, fudge, etc. This list goes on and on. The second time we came here we went to the Sunday brunch. Just as amazing, only instead of the mac and cheese bar, there was an omelet station that was great. They had an amazing stuffed french toast to die for, breakfast items- cereals, oatmeal, eggs benedict, bacon, sausages, pancakes, and some other food- shrimp cocktail, different pasta dishes, sushi. They only had 3 different sushi rolls but the fish was very good. Unusual for a buffet. \nAll in all, everything was amazing. Delicious. Everyone I went with rolled out of there stuffed to oblivion. Something for everyone. Very different kind of buffet. Original dishes. Kind of \"Iron Chef\" meet buffet. Lol. Dinner was $30 a head I think, brunch with unlimited mimosas/champagne $37 and lunch is $19. Go for lunch cheaply, and then when you love it, commit to dinner and go back!!! Can't wait to go next time I am back in Vegas! Def the best part of the new, swanky, Cosmo hotel & casino.","review_id":"UpWpF-VgaSlsjDgWDyZRKg","stars":5,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":1,"useful":1,"user_id":"rhBT5AQi8LPTc3Mk2Qpxpw","date":"2011-07-13"},{"cool":1,"text":"We love wicked spoon.

It's also quite a walk far into the hotel, wayyyy past marquee. Their seating is unique, with tables and then high-legged bar tables. They also organized their buffet in a very smart and easy way. \n\nLoved the macaroni & cheese station- I got mine with mushrooms, tomatoes, and bacon, and I couldn't stop eating it. It's made personally for you so it's pipin hot and cheesy.\n\nTheir mashed potatoes are bomb, they're probably 70% butter, but who cares? \n\nI was seriously disappointed in their spaghetti though.. how can you mess that up?? The sauce was flavorless and their lamb meatballs were in dire need of salt. So sad. \n\nTheir asian food isn't bad, they have a sushi station where you can get hand rolls. I got spicy tuna (of course), and it was delish. Their kalbi wasn't too shabby either! \n\nI love that almost everything was served in individual dishes. It seriously helps with portion control, plus it just makes everything seem more sanitary. It kinda sucks that their plates are small though, because those individual dishes take up so much room on it, and you can only get so much food at a time. \n\nAlso, I love crabby legs at buffets, but the ones here were hit or miss. Some of them were fresh and delicious, and some of them were an off-white, brownish color, flakey, and tasted old. Tsk tsk. \n\nHowever, can we talk about their desserts? Seriously, some of the most GORGEOUS desserts I've ever seen. They're all presented beautifully, in cute, small sizes to maximize the desserts you can try. My faves were the beignets (so light and delicious) and the chocolate cups with berries and chocolate pudding. Yummmmmmmmm!! They have gelato too.

I compare all Vegas buffets to the Champagne brunch at the Bellagio, which is pretty amazing. But you pay for it. Really, my main problem with Wicked Spoon was that I wanted breakfast but they had mostly lunch/dinner items in their \"brunch\" service.  There was just one guy at the omelette station and he was working his a$$ off because at 11am in Vegas most people are just barely waking up and that was the only egg option in the buffet.  They also had some pancakes that looked like they had been sitting out way too long and some waffles which I tried but didn't finish because they were really soggy.\n\nI like the concept of the small individual portions instead of the huge trays like most buffets.  It is visually much more appealing. But don't fool yourself into thinking that they didn't prepare that dish in bulk and then plate it up and leave it under the heat lamps for an hour. You can tell that after the first bite. Some of the items were room temperature which is not good. They weren't too busy when we were there so maybe that's why? I don't know, I guess that's a problem for all buffets. It didn't stop me from getting some of the Mac and cheese in the cute little skillet or edamame in the chinese takeout box.","review_id":"a0BcPBZ68jBZRm_o_hCvcg","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":2,"useful":4,"user_id":"Tsm8VraTp5OGyVALtUiCeQ","date":"2012-03-31"},{"cool":0,"text":"I want to give them 3.5 stars only cuz the butter for their crab legs is kinda funky.

So how does Wicked Spoon compare to the Bellagio Gourmet Buffet (weekends only), which is still the best buffet in Vegas? Not very well.\n\nWhen you go to a buffet that costs almost $40, you're really not looking for variations on, say, chicken preparation. You can get chicken for under a couple of bucks a pound at almost any supermarket. Or at least if you are, you shouldn't be shelling out $40 for a buffet - just go to Old Country or Golden Corral.\n\nAt a $40 buffet, you're looking for a large selection of relatively expensive foods. At the Bellagio Gourmet Buffet, which I went to one night before Wicked Spoon, there was Peking duck, prime rib, Chilean sea bass, kobe beef, sushi (with actual raw fish), poke (sashimi prepared Hawaiian style), etc. - you can't find a single one of these items at more pedestrian buffets.\n\nWhat do you get at Wicked Spoon? Only prime rib that's above ordinary and then fairly ordinary ingredients prepared slightly fancifully and presented in uppity small metal containers that are made in France.

Price for lunch was about $19 a person. Upon first look, you'll notice that this place is pretty classy for a buffet; all the way down to the plates, glasses and silverware. Not surprising, considering how over the top the Cosmopolitan already is.\n\nFood isn't as common as you'd see in other buffets. In attempts to \"class it up\" most food is portioned for you, meaning that you won't be slopping food down on your plates. Instead, you'll be going around picking up smaller plates/dishes and possibly scooping  some veggies on your plate. This seemed to work, seeing that my plate hardly ever looked messy. In other buffets, my plate always looked like a multicultural plate of diarrhea piled high to my choosing. I always felt like I was eating a classy meal here with each serving.\n\nIn conjunction with most buffets around Vegas, you'll be getting foods from varying cultures. There's the Asian, Italian, Mexican, American, and Middle Eastern influences. You'll notice that the chef's put their own little touch on each entr√©e to make their dishes a little unique. Whenever I got meat from the carving stations, it did seem pretty dry and flavorless. The rest of the food here never blew my mind, but they weren't bad either. \n\nThe dessert station was  the highlight of the entire buffet. Offering selections such as homemade fudge, crepes, giant chocolate dipped strawberries, and gelato, it was hard to go wrong with anything here.\n\nThere was one little pet peeve though, in which I was told was going to be fixed soon. None of the food was labeled. I was often guessing what I was eating most of the time. You'd have to ask the chef what an item is to truly know what you're eating. It was a bit of a pain to ask the a chef whenever I walked up to a new item.\n\nIf the food was labeled and the meat wasn't so dry, this would be a 4.5 star review. I really absolutely loved the atmosphere that the Wicked Spoon does to set itself apart from the traditional Vegas buffet. The buffet is still new, so changes and justifications are probably still going to happen. I do hope that food will also improve over time. A lot of the meats just seemed to be overcooked. Overall, I was satisfied with my buffet experience. I may drop by again to try out their dinner in the future after the place settles for a bit.\n\nPresentation: A\nFood: C+\nService: B\nValue: B","review_id":"VFKf6MgelqSgm8b_fte8tw","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":2,"useful":2,"user_id":"qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA","date":"2010-12-18"},{"cool":0,"text":"Sorry Wicked Spoon you got downgraded in stars due to your buffet closing at 3pm, yet you still seat people at 2:15pm.

You will notice they serve the foods in smaller portion plates or in little mini sized cooking pans. The selection of foods is awesome! They serve anything from salads to pasta to seafood and to different types of meat like lamb, pork, chicken, steak, and KALBI beef! I was even more thrilled to see they served dim sum and pork belly steam buns too! Yum. \n\nLets not forget the best part of it all, my guilty pleasure.... \nWhite/Dark Chocolate covered strawberries. Mmm.

The layout is really nice, with cool eclectic decor. Nice open walkways too. Perfect, if you are a balancing a crap load of food! =P\n\nSome standouts I really enjoyed: butternut squash ravioli, the spareribs, the prime rib (sooooo tender!) and the creamed corn. All were delicious. \n\nI found the rest of the food to be ok. I avoided the food I knew I could get at restaurants, like fried rice, pad thai and sushi. I tried the fish dishes and it was cooked well. Really flaky. Crab legs were good. Not too salty and they weren't served cold like the ones at the Bellagio. The bone marrow was an interesting surprise. But tasted really oily. I didn't think any of the food was too creative or unique. While some were pretty tasty, I felt like I could have found it at any other buffet on the strip. There weren't too many dishes that were memorable. Oh and of course, everything is served to you in small dishes. Which is great for portion control and presentation. But it can get kind of annoying when trying to balance everything on a bigger plate. I didn't mind it though. It's kind of like a quick grab and go. Be careful that the dish isn't too hot when you touch it though! \n\nThe desserts were gorgeous. I really wish they would have laid out all the desserts in the little cups. I saw a lot of interesting ones through the glass display I wanted to try. I wouldn't have finish them all though. Lots of chocolates, creams and mousses. They also had these huge chocolate covered strawberries. HUGE. Sooooo sweeet too. Along with that, you could also make your own strawberry shortcake. Everything looked so yummy. Oh and the gelato! Strawberry balsamic was interesting, but I really enjoyed the peanut butter cup flavor. There was a good variety of flavors to choose from too. I think there was at least 12 different types of gelato. \n\nDinner was about $35 per person on a Saturday night, not including tax and tip.

The WIFI doesn't work because it's for hotel guests only so you get little to no service while you're waiting in line. Then there's the price, it's $35 for the buffet, but if you want \"bottomless\" champagne, bloody marys, etc. it's $45. \n\nThe issue with that is, it's not bottomless, your waiter doesn't just refill your glass when it's empty, you need to request it and since you're always up standing in lines to get food, you get maybe 3 glasses if you're lucky. Oh and in fine print, they mention that you can only redeem the \"bottomless\" alcohol for 2 hours from payment. To me, it doesn't make sense, because you're standing in line AGAIN after you pay, so you really have about an hour to redeem your \"bottomless\" alcoholic drinks. \n\nThen there's the water served at the tables, it's pretty to serve it in a glass bottle but it still tastes like tap water. Just don't lie to us and serve us in regular pitchers, we won't be upset. \n\nAnd what buffet such as this one doesn't have crab legs or lobsters? I know it doesn't say that it's a seafood buffet, but come on, even the Bellagio carries crab legs and lobsters and it doesn't have the name \"Seafood\" in its name anywhere. I do like that it has ethnic food options which was pretty cool, overall. \n\nAlso, I don't think this buffet is as big as some of the other buffets I've been to, but it's still pretty good nonetheless.

Reasonable. \n\n1st plate; I got the meat ball with feta cheese. Definitely the best tasting meatball i've ever had. Please forgive me grandma! I swear i'm still loyal to your meatballs, haha. Next i went with the the tacos, cant remember the exact name but i went back for seconds so that must tell you how amazing they were. 2 came on a plate and they were perfectly portioned. The meat was tender and had just enough onions and cilantro atop. I got pancakes to finish the plate off but in the end i didn't get to eat them because my 7 month old little girl stole them off my plate and ate them up. She loved them so they must have been good. \n\n2nd plate; Went with a caesar salad so that i could feel a little better about eating so unhealthy. It was good. Liked the dressing but felt like it was missing something.. maybe a little more romaine lettuce? The cheese and crutons were good. I liked it over all. Next I had some shrimp with the sauce, it was good. Normal. Nothing special. On my plate was the mac n cheese. Gosh was that good. Not the best I've ever had but it was up there with some competition! Mmm, so creamy, and thick. Had a nice crust on top. Prime rib was also on my plate. Cooked to perfection. I like my meat medium rare and thats exactly how it was prepared. Gosh i wish i had some now. yum! On top i added some of their hash browns. Now get this... i HATE hash browns. I tihnk they're dry, burnt yet under cooked and flavorless.. YET here i saw their hash browns and had to get them. They were the best tasting hash browns i've ever had in my life.

The fried chicken was delicious (better than Bacchanal).

You can actually tell by eating the food that a completely different crew cooks the food for the dinner service, and they don't seem to do it well as the lunch service.  For example, for lunch I tried some of the best mashed potatoes I have ever had at a buffet and at most restaurants, and I normally do not go near carbs when I'm at buffets.  They were smooth and insanely buttery.  However, for dinner they were completely different.  They were some of the worst potatoes that were so lumpy and just not executed well.\n\nAlso, what also worried me at dinner was that many of the lunch items sat around until the dinner service around the day, and never got replaced.  They close for approximately three hours between lunch and dinner, yet they never put out new food.  For example, they have pound cake in the dessert area that was dry and crusty because it had sat out all day.  I had the same cake (with fresh berries at lunch) that was moist and delicious.  Also, they had some pork tacos for lunch with fresh cut lime.  They had the same tacos for dinner, and the same limes were sitting out, all massively petrified and dry because they literally sat out all day.

The Mexican station because the Guacamole wasn't green, so i just stayed clear, besides i could just get a darn good burrito anywhere for $6 right?!  The Japanese station, i tried one of the shrimp takoyaki (no tako just shrimp) and it was just mushy inside so i just passed on everything else, the sushi didn't look too fresh either.  The Chinese section was just cliche, beef broccoli, noodles, ect.  The Crispy 5 spice roast pork from the Chinese section was really good though, i mean who doesn't like crispy pork skin?!\n\nI really liked the dessert table, gelato bar, chocolate dipped strawberries with either oreo cookie crust or crushed heath bar, just wish i had saved room for more dessert there was a bunch of other desserts i wanted to try but just didnt have room.\n\nI came during brunch, but reading other reviews, seems like there are crab legs and prime rib during dinner, or maybe just on different days.

Why not! I noticed that it had strong ratings and know its more fancier buffet or upscale strip buffet. The location is interesting because not on the casino floor of the Cosmo but on the second floor so takes some work too find it. Once you get there thinking is this really buffet because the interior screams nothing of the type. The tables not your typical all sane size two or fours or connect bunch of tables together. You have nice couch type of four tops, even have bar stool long tables, wine self service machine (least that what I could gather since non of us drank wine that night), and really nice vibe too it.\n\nThe food was hit or miss. There were few good things but also for all the good felt like just as much bad. The fried rice pretty much bland but like the presentation in the little chinese to go box. The yakisoba noodles were awesome. Most of the cold seafood apps was fan of from the tako salad, shrimp ceviche, shrimp with grits, and caesar salad. The craving station not fan of the pork belly (the pieces were huge chunks: besides no one at the craving station), the kalbi short ribs were just flat out fatty pieces and gross, never tried the prime rib but looked okay, and might have had something else. I enjoyed the tacos lot between the pulled pork and chicken had go back twice just for more tacos. The fresh salsa and guacamole was good. The jalapeno cornbread was tasty had too get seconds on that one. I do like the diversity with the menu between the three different areas. Dessert area that one that nothing but HIT after HIT. The gelatos, too the petite fours of rice krispies bars, macrons, and every other little dessert delight could think of they had out. So make sure you leave room for desserts when you come too Wicked Spoon. \n\nThis whole little sauce puts and tapa style plates. Too be fair not all of the food small portions. NOT FAN. I love the look too it! No doubt keeps you from going buffet excess cause in reality no way can fit as much on plate. But really after the second trip gets irritating so I just double stacking pots or plates save trip. \n\nThe service unfortunately hate too be mean but our waitress literally forgot what we order for drinks had too come back twice too make sure got it right. She took long time too get our drinks. Half the time notice she was talking too group at another table and not really playing attention too other guests. Our glasses always empty and not on it came too clearing out dirty plates. Bad service. \n\nIn closing say that maybe cause not fan of buffets in general.

Me likes no loves that. There wasn't any over crowding or hospital lighting. The food oh the food. I was sufficiently wowed by Wicked Spoon from start to finish. The food was on par with the high end eateries in the Cosmopolitan. The variety for brunch was good. My helpful waiter let me know the only change from lunch/brunch to dinner is the removal of the brunch items section with the addition of a few dinner items.  So I would say brunch is the best bet $ wise. Gelato bar was yummy and worth every calorie I consumed for it. They had a chocolate, carmel & salty peanut gelato that tasted like the perfect snickers. I had the Miso poached cod served over asparagus & it was to die for & I'm not a Cod kind of girl The only warning would be... steer clear of the Bloody Mary's which had nasty vodka & NO worcestershire sauce. The other is for the line. Please  get a preferred line for hotel guests so that can just in general feel warm & fuzzy for dropping my coin & hotel loyalty on your fine buffet.

I had plenty of opportunities to eat here, but promised my teenager that I wouldn't eat here without her. \n\nSo it's set. She's in town for a couple of days and Wicked Spoon was on her radar this time around (I swear, she's a Yelper in training).  We purposely arrived about an hour near closing because I figured that the lines wouldn't be as bad then.  I was right, only waited about 20 minutes to get into our seats.  Overall service was great and for that I cannot complain.  I feel the ambiance and the decor.  I even love their tables and wish I had that pattern at home.  But this review is about the food, right? \n\nIn my opinion, if you've been to one buffet in Las Vegas, you've been to them all.  The dishes here are served in mini-portions, which I think is great for pictures.  But lousy for a buffet.  When I think buffet, I think as much as I want.  Give their Fried Chicken Wings as an example.  You get two pieces presented in a cute stainless steel strainer.  But if I wanted 6 pieces, I would have to grab 3 of these bad boys, really? How about their Angry Mac N' Cheese.  The portions are small and if I wanted a little more, than I'm grabbing multiple tins of these.  Again, great for photos, but not convenient for eating.  This is pretty much the experience with all their mini-dishest.  By the time I was done, I've tried their fried chicken, roasted chicken, salmon, sushi (don't do it), mac n cheese, and their garlic pizza.  All were just about par with every one else on the strip.  Not bad in taste, not the greatest either.  \n\nNow for dessert...This is where Wicked Spoon has their one shining moment.  It's all about desserts here.  From presentation to taste, you really can't go wrong with their desserts. Their macarons weren't that great, but everything else disappeared once it made it to my table.  \n\nOverall, I have to give Wicked Spoon just 3 stars because it's just okay compared to the rest of the strip buffets out there. For $35 a person for lunch, I think I could get more bang for my buck outside of the strip.  I'm sure I will eventually be back.

That impression changed the more I looked more thoroughly.  Treasures were to be found!  Like:  perfectly cooked shrimp cocktail in tiny cups, tasty tiny tacos with delectable topping choices, succulent asiago-stuffed gnocchi with asparagus and tomato (very rich), perfectly fried chicken wing pieces (and I normally don't do fried chicken), savory salads like fennel with grapefruit and orange and grilled asparagus, flavorful black pepper turkey, thin crust delicious pizzas like sausage and olive and bbq chicken.\n   It's all about what you like or what you're in the mood for, and fortunately here there are so many options. With brunch there was plenty of breakfast stuff (which we ignored).   Desserts were very good also.  I absolutely loved the purple macaroon with fresh berries and a dab of chocolate.

The carving station has peaking duck, beef (forget if it was prime rib or roast beef), and turkey which was all moist and flavorful.

The truffle potatoes Au gratin and regular mashed potatoes were perfectly made. Salads, meatballs in the Italian section and Asian pork buns all the way to the right side was all good.

No prime rib either.\n\nThe service would have been good but we didn't get our drinks until after we had already finished eating. Overall I wouldn't recommend this buffet at all. I've had better ones at old dingy Vegas casino's. This is the Cosmopolitan, a five star joint.

I found myself trying to find something to eat but nothing looked good. I have to admit, I mostly ate ebi sushi, which was very good for a buffet. They put a little bit of wasabi under the shrimp, so it had a nice spicy flavor. I also had some chicken from the chinese section that wasn't bad. Besides that, nothing else looked appetizing. Like I said, I'm picky!\n\nOne thing I usually like about going to a buffet is the desert bar. I like that you can get a variety of things to try out.

Mussels cooked in coconut curry sauce, a caterpillar roll, sesame chicken and BBQ shrimp and grits were my initial choices with each recommendable though many of the mussel shells were unopened and needed to be discarded.  I selected bone marrow, among a number of other dishes, on my next run through, but it was uneatable due to overcooking.

I believe that it is an experience meant for mass-consumption of an unhealthy amount of food that is never truly spectacular and provides for a lackluster experience that is meant only to fill your stomach. That being said, I was won over by Wicked Spoon. It featured food in new and creative ways while preserving quality over quantity. Needless to say, it wasn't the most remarkable dining experience you will ever have, however it will make you think \"did I really just go to a buffet?\"\n\nSet in the recesses of the Cosmopolitan resort, getting there can be a challenge in itself. Whoever designed Las Vegas resorts to get you to set destinations clearly set a slot machine or a poker table in your way. Be prepared with some comfortable shoes, because no matter where you park your car or if you valet, the trek is clearly enough to burn off your first plate of food (I'm exaggerating here for the record). Yet if that isn't enough to deter you, the line to pay followed up by the line to be seated might be. Don't give up. \n\nWhen you finally are seated, you are greeted by a diorama of epicurean treats that are hard to be rivaled. From the lighter fare to the more delectable treats, our brunch buffet was among the best I ever had. The smaller plates encourage variety and expanding your taste palate with bites uncommon to the normal buffet. Forget the mass produced scrambled eggs, the cold pancakes and such. Bring on the mushroom risotto with truffle oil, thick cut slow roasted bacon, or perhaps the desire for the gelato bar might arise. \n\nThe smoked salmon mousse in a cone could be passed up, the watermelon with feta and balsamic reduction right next door shouldn't be passed up. While simple, the crisp flavor of the watermelon is complemented with the salty feta and the sweet tart of the vinegar. While it might be over in a bite, I guarantee you will be back for a couple more of them. The bacon was heaven. Not too fatty or oily, but still offering the silky saltiness to go with your made to order omelet. \n\nBe sure to save room for dessert because the gelato was extremely well done along with the other small morsels set away enough to avoid the drool that will escape your mouth. \n\nService was good. Who would have thought I would be talking about service at a buffet!? Yet here I am including the fact that the staff quickly cleared plates, were incredibly pleasant, and never let the water glasses go full. Service usually is tolerable at a normal buffet, Wicked Spoon clearly takes it up a notch.\n\nWhile the buffet has become an integral part of Las Vegas cuisine, don't skimp on the $9.99 buffet that might dote the landscape. Let the wallet be a little loose and skip the slots for an hour and check out the Wicked Spoon. It is definitely worth the experience.","review_id":"kYdZRUtXuugJ_mFkHf1E7A","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":5,"useful":9,"user_id":"Gg3K7jsyWEl6TlGmhodODg","date":"2014-03-11"},{"cool":13,"text":"Just like every restaurant, bar & bathroom housed in The Cosmopolitan Hotel, the Wicked Spoon Buffet is decorated so avant-garde, so posh that you forget your own name just looking at its chandeliers. \n\nI LOVE that food is pre-portioned in its own single-serve bowls & dishes.

Very strange. Anyway, we returned for lunch the next day (Monday), and they were open. It wasn't too busy, and there was no line around 11:30am so we were seated right away. We tried:\n\n-Plate #1: Wicked Mac n Cheese, Pizza Rolls, Beets Salad, Grilled Jalapeno, Bacon Slab, Bone Marrow (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=iWbdh3wDFeaEOY-XYFrgBw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The bone marrow was the best out of that plate, and it's worth eating a couple/few of these if you're not concerned about your cholesterol. The beets salad, grilled jalapeno, and bacon slab were solid, but not seconds worthy. The mac n cheese was pretty disappointing, as was the pizza roll.\n-Plate #2: California Roll, Crispy Orange Chicken, Stir Fried Beef Noodles, Curry Clam, Korean Fried Chicken Wing, Crispy Roast Pork (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=yFByFI9eOKngHTh08naIeg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Their sushi selection is crap, and the rice is super mushy. The inside of the California roll was decent, but I wouldn't get it again. The crispy orange chicken was gross since it was mostly crisp, but the rest of the items weren't bad. I liked the beef noodles and chicken wing the best out of the plate.\n-Plate #3: Chocolate Croissant, Chocolate Chip Cookie, Banana Tart, Dulce de Leche Cheesecake, Carrot Cake, Pistachio Chocolate Cake (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hacStRd6-LDsRz5W58RikA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The best was the carrot cake, and I would skip the rest.

The waffle bowl is pretty good, but you can also ask that they put the gelato in a bowl . Overall, I thought the food at Wicked Spoon was really disappointing, in both the selection and taste, and would much rather go to Bacchanal at Caesar's instead. At least the price of lunch wasn't too bad, something like $24/person.

I loved it! The restaurant, like everything in the Cosmo hotel, is decorated beautifully. You won't find the troughs of fettucini alfredo and Panda Express quality Chinese food here. You get amazing things like a variety of fancy cheeses, gnocchi with ricotta and lamb bolognese sauce, mac and cheese bar (I made a cheddar, goat cheese, asparagus, and caramelized onion mac and cheese and seriously wanted to lick the plate.... oh em gee), shepherd's pie, bone marrow, goat cheese ravioli with lobster broth sauce, truffled potato au gratin, rich soups (potato when I was there) and a wide selection of salad. All of these things were amazing! I also love that everything is in individual containers so the food doesn't mix together. This is genius! There were some misses on the buffet like the Chinese food (wasn't really my thing) and the spaghetti with lamb meatballs was good, but cold. Despite this, I definitely got my 35$s worth with all of the amazing things I had. THEN it was on to dessert. I think the best items were the chocolate lava cake (with coffee ice cream on top, as suggested by a very friendly employee) and the tiramisu in a chocolate cup. The chocolate cake was soooo goood, probably the best dessert I have had at a buffet. They also had HUGE chocolate covered strawberries in 3 different varieties. Of course, some of the desserts were not so hot, but that's the deal with buffets. \n\nI have been to several buffets in Vegas (Rio, Flamingo, Bellagio, Paris, Excalibur, etc)  and this was BY FAR the best.

There wasn't much of a selection. They had Korean Short ribs, which were yummy, but a bit too salty. The sushi is just as good as sushi is in any other buffet (hint: NOT good). The made to order hand rolls were decent. The Chinese food was almost insulting to my Chinese girlfriend. The cool thing about this buffet is that some of the entrees are prepared on a little dish that you can just grab, instead of having to scoop em onto your plate (\"Tapas-style\" I'm told?).\n\nTHE VENUE: \nThe dining area is probably the nicest dining area you'll find at a buffet. The orange/yellow lights were a cool accent on the dark wood and aluminum trim. Very impressive. The booths were taken straight out of a lounge and everything looked and felt expensive.\n\nTHE SERVICE:\nOur waiter was nice and attentive.

I must say I was less than impressed. Granted, it was on a weekday, at lunch time, and around 1300 (lunch service stops at 1400). \n\nI was curious to tyr this new concept of \"tapas buffet\", in the end I don't think it worked out very well.  The serving size is actually more than I usually get. I normally get one or two bites to taste, then go back for more if I like it. The serving sizes were pretty hefty, so it was kind of pointless to put them in small pots or rammekins. I was definitely underwhelmed with the variety, I was expecting all these great dishes that I had been reading about, but I guess those are only brought out for dinner and on weekends. The stuff that was servied didn't seem really special. Three out the four sushi rolls had cream cheese, the pad thai was terrible, the rice noodles and dashi stock was plain....\n\nThe worst problems with this buffet were 1. the lack of turn over (I waited all through lunch for tzatziki sauce) and 2. the lack of labels, especially for desserts. Speaking of desserts, a lot fo gooey cakes and parfaits that were too sweet, but there are a good selection of gelatos and berries (blueberries, rasberries, and blackberries frozen and thawed). \n\nService was okay, slow to start, but it picked up after a bit.

Not just variety, but quality variety.\n\nIt's nestled in the \"back\" of the Cosmopolitan. So I feel like it's in an overlooked spot in an overlooked casino? There are signs, but you'll need to follow them upstairs and through some hallways in order to reach Wicked Spoon. While it is out of the way, it's also not right off a casino floor, which is nice, a bit less hectic.\n\nIt markets itself as a little more of a foodie buffet, and I think it's delivers. For Sunday brunch, they had things like gnocchi in tomato sauce, polenta with braised lamb, and wild mushroom risotto. There was their \"wicked\" fried chicken and mac & cheese (legitimately spicy, in the case of the mac & cheese), as well as a large buffet of cold cheeses and meats. Good shrimp dumplings and dry fried green beans were also available. While you could get \"American\" breakfast, I was uninterested in the face of their Italian and Asian counters. There's also several carving stations with good beef and pork options. I was stuffed by the time we got around to dessert, where there's a gelatto counter and dozens of small cakes, cookies, macaroons, and even bitter chocolate cakes, swimming in mini-cast iron skillets of caramel.\n\nFor about $15 extra, you can get unlimited mimosas or bloody marys, which, we figured, meant we'd have to get two drinks over the course of the meal to break even. Easy deal when you consider the waiter was bringing two at a time for everyone at the table...we had a forest of mimosas by the end of the meal. So even if the drinks were a bit weak by reports, we had no problems getting them.\n\nBrunch ran me (sans alcohol option) about $38. Was it a lot for brunch? Maybe.

Wicked Spoon tries to be a little different and they succeed in many ways. I'm giving them a 5 for now, even though they do have a few issues that will hopefully be ironed out once they are open longer. \n\nBased on reviews from other Yelpers, they seem to still be trying out different things since some of the items mentioned by others were not present when I was there and I'm sure I had some things that others did not have. I ended up eating here twice my last trip. I enjoyed it so much I cancelled my steakhouse reservation to eat at Wicked Spoon again. The items were definitely different on both nights. Even the presentation was different on some of the items. They have a really good cold bar. I ate several of the crab and shrimp cocktails. This is a great place for those who have eaten at all the other buffets and are looking for a change of pace. I lost count of the number of items they offered that you really can't get at any other buffet. While other new buffets try to be more and more extravagant, this one tries to be different. with great results. My favorite item was the blackened lamb ribs. \n\nNow for the areas that need improvement. Service is definitely an issue. The line moves slow, although I think that can be credited largely to the buffet being new and people are still getting used to their jobs. It seems like they will eventually have some self serve kiosks, but they were not being used when I was there. The servers also seem to be overwhelmed. They may want to consider hiring more servers since the nature of this buffet (small plates, pans, baskets, bottles, etc.) generates more that needs clearing. That being said, the service was friendly and very good, if a little slow. The servers seemed really proud to be there though, which is always a good thing. They also need to stock cold plates in the cold bar and dessert sections. The dessert selection is a bit small. I wish they had some little cakes or something. \n\nThe Asian food section is the one that needs the most work right now. It was the weakest section and needs more variety. I'm guessing their chef has very little experience with Asian cuisine since even the simple dishes were messed up. The Korean short ribs, for example, were overcooked and drowning in sauce. The dim sum needs to be made in smaller batches.\n\nMinor quibbles aside, this is a very good buffet.

The nice part about buffets are the options.\n\nWicked Spoon has a lot of great options.  You will find a sushi option with 3 different rolls and cold salad dishes; a standard salad bar with stuff like fruit; if you are going to the brunch buffet on the weekend they have muffins, toast, cereal staples along with tons of other options like a prime rib counter that serves other meat like lamb; various pasta dishes, casseroles (asiago polenta, roasted mushrooms), and steamed mussels and clams.  The clams were my favorite.  They also have shrimp cocktail though the weekend we went they did not have the snow crab.  We also did not get any complimentary mimosa like another reviewer noted back in the summer.\n\nIf you make it to the dessert bar you will find an array of pie and cake and gelato, plus chocolate covered strawberries.\n\nNote that when you arrive there are 2 lines:  the first line you wait in is where you will pay and get your \"ticket\".  Then you go get in another line with your ticket and wait to be seated.  Wicked Spoon can get popular and the wait can run more than an hour at times.  We waited about 20 minutes on a weekend in December.\n\nMy favorite buffet on the strip is still the Wynn's buffet.

I made my own sauce concoction that consisted of horseradish, onion, and cilantro, and it made an already yummy dish even better. The Ox-Tail Pho was one of the best pho soups I've had in my lifetime. The ox-tail broth brought an enhanced beef flavor and the accompanying basil, jalapenos, green onions, and raw sprouts calmed the broth back to what you would expect from pho. \n\nThe dessert bar, carving station, salads, and other dishes simply tasted average. The fried chicken was dry and the blue cheese wedge salad was no better than any other salad buffet.

Wicked Spoon in The Cosmopolitan became my second trip to a Vegas buffet (also for breakfast).  This trip though yielded both breakfast and lunch and dinner items (I do not remember the Bellagio Buffet offering many dinner items at breakfast, but that was a long time ago).\n\nThere were a wide variety of lunch and dinner items.  There were several stations I did not try like the sushi and Chinese food.  I did try some more of their New American offerings though.  All of it was kind of just okay.  The crispy chicken wings were crunchy and crispy and well seasoned, but they had been sitting around too long.  The duck confit ravioli was not bad, but it was really kind of a just okay flavor--heavy and not that interesting of a cream sauce.  The beef short rib was decent--moist and tender.  The tri-tip (sliced to order) was just okay.\n\nIn terms of breakfast, their selection was impressive.  They had several breakfast pastries, breads and muffins available.  Some looked better than others.  The pain au chocolat was not bad for a breakfast buffet.\n\nThere was also a good number of cold items from fresh fruit to several salads.  For more heartier breakfast items, Wicked Spoon had about every dish you would expect to find at one of those all-day breakfast places.  There were many egg dishes (as well as eggs made to order), pancakes, French toast, and several breakfast meat offerings.\n\nThe breakfast meats stood out the most.  There were two kinds of bacon.  The first was crispy strips of bacon (piled up in a traditional buffet serving dish).  For breakfast buffet bacon, this was pretty good.  The bacon was crispy but not burnt and there was a decent meaty chew.  There was also a smoked bacon that they sliced to order, which had a meatier and more tender feel to it (closer to braised pork belly than traditional breakfast bacon).\n\nThe chicken apple sausage was good--moist and nicely seasoned with a decent amount of spice.\n\nThe French toast was also good--light and fluffy (with a good flavor).  The pancakes were fine.\n\nThe eggs Benedict was just okay.  The hollandaise sauce was too thick and the meat was thickly shaved ham as opposed to Canadian bacon.  I also tried an omelet made to order and it was not that good.  It was not that fluffy and the cheese was not melted at all.\n\nIn addition to their many savory offerings at breakfast, Wicked Spoon also offers a wide variety of desserts.  There were cakes, housemade marshmallows, chocolate molten cakes (though not that molten), and gelato.  The flavors of the gelato were very good--a nice caramel and a distinct pistachio flavor.  The gelato was creamy and smooth but a tad too soft.\n\nService was okay.  The staff was quick with getting drink orders in, but they were kind of slow in taking away plates.\n\nThe price was right around $25.  I think that is about what you would expect to pay at breakfast buffets at similar Las Vegas hotels.\n\nThe dining room is comfortable enough though I remember the Bellagio Buffet having more booth seating.\n\nThe Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon Buffet offers a great variety of food for breakfast.  Some of their offerings (like their breakfast meats) are quite good, but most items fall in the just okay or maybe slightly below average range.  Still, if you like buffets because of the great amount of choice they offer, Wicked Spoon seems like a good option.\n\nI know The Cosmopolitan offers free valet parking.  I think this hotel also offers free self parking.","review_id":"lVP5yuKkiYeE6-7p-W15ag","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":15,"useful":25,"user_id":"w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ","date":"2013-01-27"},{"cool":0,"text":"Although not generally a big fan of buffets I was a bit intrigued by the seeming 'competition' between Wicked Spoon, Bellagio, and Wynn for having the 'best buffet on the Strip'.  Ratings for all three seemed pretty similar, with each one having people who insisted it was the best of the three no matter what others say.  I'm pretty sure I am not going to visit all three buffets on this trip because I just am not that big on buffets, but I figured I would visit the closest one to my hotel, which was Wicked Spoon.  (Close being relative, it took 45 minutes from my room at the MGM Grand to walk there).  \n\nMy verdict - it has a few gems, but I would still far rather eat at a nice regular restaurant because the average of all the items was 'decent', not 'great'.  This was at breakfast, there assuredly is a different selection later in the day, but overall I do not have high hopes that the quality was better then.\n\nHere's what I tried, from what I can remember -\n\nVery good:\nGelato (the Almond Joy is as good as people say)\n\nGood:\nGoat cheese ravioli (this one has mixed reviews, but I liked it)\nSpicy crab roll (not the best I've had but it had nice flavor, I must have gotten a fresh one)\nCheesy hash browns\n\nMediocre:\nAngry mac 'n' cheese (bland and too milky)\nSpaghetti (bland)\nKalbi (too tough, and the sauce had the totally wrong flavor)\nhomemade italian sausage (too greasy)\npuffy pastry with fruit and cream on it (the fruit and cream was good, the pastry itself tasted stale-ish)\nBelgian waffle with amaretto ricotta(?) -- sounded a lot better than it tasted\n\nBad:\nFried rice on the chinese buffet - took one bite and decided it wasn't worth it.\n\nStuff I didn't try because it looked icky - mainly the pizza and other Chinese selections\n\nI never got a piece of prime rib because it was always being cooked, and I didn't have time to wait (or got full before it was done).  \n\nThe server never refilled my soda, but there was a nice bottle of water on the table so I wouldn't have gone thirsty.  \n\nSo as I said before, it wasn't horrible, but it really isn't great and if you can afford it your dollars are better spent at one of the many nice sit-down places in town.  If Bellagio and Wynn buffets are of similar quality, I doubt I'm missing much there either.  In retrospect, I think I actually preferred the buffet in the north side of town that I reviewed the other day, that was $9.99 and not pretentiously fancy.","review_id":"xys2V1__M5PNgqi5bWOThA","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":1,"useful":0,"user_id":"51Dg7npqsTegnd1ZDxVb3w","date":"2012-03-28"},{"cool":0,"text":"not bad, but i was definitely underwhelmed after looking at all the delicious pics on yelp. they were out of a lot of items and didn't have that much of a variety (weird, i know). i walked around for a long time trying to find something appealing, and actually had a pretty hard time. i thought maybe it was just me, but a majority of my party couldn't find much they wanted either. although i will say a few of my friends did get around four plates during the meal!\n\nthey also didn't ask us if we wanted alcohol with our brunch-which my entire party did-but didn't realize it was an extra fee until we got to the table. after standing in the line for a thousand years, we obviously weren't go to go through that again just for booze. either way, it was kind of a buzzkill. \n\nthe best things i had were the thai tea gelato and the mini ice cream cones.","review_id":"MJxNRtmFHl6PxIXl2mBjyQ","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"_jvpuLE8claM2mi6jMKXOA","date":"2013-08-18"},{"cool":1,"text":"Since the only other Vegas buffet I've been to was the Wynn, the bar was very high for me on this one.

The line for the buffet was not too long when we arrived around 5:30. This was my first time dining at this buffet. I have never heard about this place until then, but was told it received four stars on Yelp. So I was looking forward to some yummy all you can eat food.\n\nSadly, no stuffing my face with delicious food occurred =( The quality of the dinner selection was substandard. Especially when it costs $35+ per person. The crab legs were dry. The bone marrow tasted funny. The Korean BBQ was extremely salty. They didn't have clam. Gosh, I can't even tell you what else I've tried since the food was so unmemorable. \n\nBut one thing I do recall about the food is that this place tries to change things up. They would have a mix of unusual and/or exotic flavors for dishes. \"A\" for effort, but borderline \"C or D\" for the results. Some of the dishes just tasted weird. Or the spice was too overpowering.\n\nThe only things that tasted good that evening was the cream of corn, strawberries, and green tea.\n\nWicked Spoon also had an array of desserts to choose from. From ice creams to chocolate covered strawberries and variety of pastries. I tried the chocolate strawberries. They weren't bad. But after eating 3 of them, I was done.\n\nCustomer Service: 5 Stars. From the cashier to the hostess, to our waitress, all of them were friendly.\n\nWould I suggest this place for Dinner? No. \n\nTry the Brunch/Lunch instead.","review_id":"vNBkepJSKGCOMEHWcr1lug","stars":2,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":3,"user_id":"qlaVQkSxKcqfHJhoZU3rKg","date":"2011-09-15"},{"cool":4,"text":"Out of all the buffets I've tried in Vegas so far, Wicked Spoon is my #1.

We went at 6pm and walked in with a breeze.\n\nIf you have any vegetarians in your group, this place is do-able for both carnivorous folk and veggies alike. \n\nFood comes in smaller portions here and is presently nicely. There is not much meat. There was prime rib, some Korean short ribs, fried chicken and one other meat dish but I only had prime rib. It was decent but definitely not the best I've ever had at a buffet. If you want good prime rib at a buffet go off the strip and hit up M Resort. \nBut I digress...\n\nANYWAY\n\nThe crab legs are minuscule here! If you're a seafood lover you'll be disappointed with that. There was barely any meat so I skipped it.\nWhy is my review still at 4 stars?\n\nWell, the personalized mac & cheese station is awesome. You go down the line and pick out what you want and a cook makes your mac n cheese dish fresh for you.\nI also loved the selection of gratins! My favorite was the truffle potato gratin. Went so well with my slice of prime rib.\nAnother winner was the Louisiana BBQ Shrimp w/ cheddar bacon grits. I LOVE ME SOME BACON AND I LOVE ME SOME GRITS. Perfect sized amount served in a little individual container.\nMy girlfriend and I also loved the wild mushroom polenta. The mushrooms were cooked PERFECTLY and so amazingly good it tasted like it had truffle in it. SO SO GOOD. \nThe gnocci was excellent. The pork & lamb meatball spaghetti wasn't that great of a hit. The meatball itself was very dry but the spaghetti's marinara sauce was on point. Like I mentioned before, everything is served in its own little plating/containers so portion control is very easy to manage here. \n\nDessert station had little macarons, chocolate mousse, gelato station, dark chocolate covered strawberries w/ nuts and some sliced strawberries with REAL FRESH HANDMADE whipped cream. None of that out of a can nitrous oxide shit. That was LEGIT. \nMy gripe with the dessert station is that other than the strawberries, there wasn't any fresh fruit! COME ON! I'm Asian! I need fruit after a meal yo! Hahahahaa... \n\nLeft feeling so content but not overly full and still somehow managed to fit into my skimpy 5th Element costume.

It doesnt make sense because what if you wanna get out of the line bc you're sick of waiting so it makes absolutely no sense why you would have to wait in line and pay. 3rd of all if i was gonna pay $45(including tax)  then i could just go to jaleo again for a nice delicious, interesting fancy dinner. \n\nHonestly the hot food really wasn't that great and the only reason why i went all out was because i had to make the money by eating all these prime ribs and crab legs.

Eating pounds and pounds of mediocre food just to get my money's worth doesn't appeal to me.  I prefer to taste, not gorge.  I like to taste lots and lots of little items and experience as many flavors as possible.\n\nAnd if you're a taster like me, Wicked Spoon is heaven.\n\nWicked Spoon is the first buffet where the majority of the food comes in individually portioned, small and bite-sized dishes.  This made me a very happy boy.\n\nAside from this unique quirk, Wicked Spoon is a fairly conventional Las Vegas buffet.  On the other hand, it's quite gorgeous, with more chandeliers and more stylish decor than most.  There's typically a line to enter, but I managed to avoid it by dining at off hours -- 7:30am for breakfast, and 5:30pm for dinner.  \n\n(Side note -- I had free passes to the buffet thanks to my Cosmopolitan rewards program, so I got to experience both breakfast and dinner at no cost -- sweet!  But expect to pay through the nose if you purchase a buffet pass yourself.)\n\nThe foods run the gamut in terms of style and quality.  The strengths lie in the desserts, I think.  I loved the macarons and apple cobbler and molten chocolate cake and endless flavors of gelato.  Every single cake and tart was perfect.\n\nThe savory foods were a little more mixed.  The vaguely \"Asian\" foods like the General Tso's chicken and pork fried rice were tasty but bland.  (Also, who eats buffet-grade sushi anyway?)  Same with the Mexican foods.\n\nOn the other hand, the American-style foods, like the fried chicken and roasted bone marrow and salmon with pea puree, were quite excellent.  The various salads were fresh and delicious, too -- especially the beet salad, asparagus salad, various takes on a green salad (spinach and kale), and that kickass caprese.\n\nI could spend hours detailing every dish I tasted, but that would be pointless, since Wicked Spoon's selection of foods changes on the reg.  You'll have to pay it a visit and see for yourself!

There was still some, but not nearly as much as dinner. I tried the Korean BBQ short ribs again this time, but it wasn't nearly as tasty as the last time I had it. However, I do recommend the calamari, that was very tasty. So was the little shrimp cocktail cups they offered. The steak is a must try though! It was unbelievably good!\n\nDesserts were a disappointment for me. During dinner, they would serve a lot of different varieties of cake and pastries. For brunch, there were very few pastries and cakes, so I opted for a couple of macarons and gelato. They made pumpkin macarons! They're not nearly as good as Lette macarons, but they weren't too bad either. Gelato was okay. I had the pistachio.

Here's the thing, I've kind of burned myself out on buffets, especially after once doing all of the buffets on the Buffet of Buffets in 24 hours once, but my tried and true, hands down best has been The M... until now.  Don't get me wrong, I still think The M is awesome, but Wicked Spoon upped the ante.\n\nI'd heard the lines can be crazy so I made my husband check in on Foursquare for three days in a row at Cosmopolitan hot spots so that he would have the badge that gets you VIP line access.  No worries there, since we went early... they open at 5pm and we were there at, um, 5:10, there was NO line.  I was surprised since it was Labor Day, but yea for us!  No wait to pay, no wait to be seated and quick access to the AMAZING food.\n\nI was a little exhausted after the five mile hike to back of the Cosmo property to FIND Wicked Spoon, but luckily sustenance was mine.  What impressed me the most was that the food was presented beautifully AND it was very good.  A lot of times buffet food is just cafeteria food, but I did not get that at all from this one.  \n\nI liked that they had your staples, prime rib, pork roast, etc at the carving station and crab legs and asian fare, BUT that they also had unusual items as well, like the General Tso pigs feet and I'm still kicking myself for getting too full before I tried the roasted marrow!  The selection is just a huge wow.  But, I noticed some things would run out quickly and I'd miss out... I never got to try the roasted beet salad, which is a favorite of mine.  \n\nMy favorite items were the prime rib (because that is always a fave for me), the build your own mac and cheese bar, the individual cheese plates (LOVE!), and this one strange little chocolate shot dessert thing that I can't describe for the life of me except to say, YUM.  I really enjoyed the \"salad/appetizer\" section because they had so many little interesting crostinis, cheeses, salads, etc.  I could graze there all night... oh wait, I did.  Oddly, my husband LOVED the dessert bar.  He seriously had three helping and this man does NOT have a sweet tooth.  STRANGE!\n\nI feel like I missed out on a lot because I just get full too fast!  What I didn't care for was the chocolate lava cake - um, no lava, and the gnocchi I had was okay, but too soft for my taste.  Surprisingly, the angry mac and cheese did not wow me.  The flavor was good, but the one I got was super dry.  Darn it.\n\nThe staff was all very friendly and attentive.  It was $41 per person on Labor Day evening 2012.  I think that is pricey, but we all felt it was an acceptable price to pay to splurge for a buffet of this caliber. I'm guessing we'll be back.\n\nWHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET FIVE STARS?\n~the food, which I loved, was a little inconsistent - not everything was cooked correctly and that dropped them a half star.\n~removal of used dishes more quickly would be a plus.  We found it odd that they would come by and remove plates, but never took our glasses away when a new one was brought so we had quite a collection of glasses - another minus half star.","review_id":"ark35Va3c1wp0YOXzJDvFg","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":1,"useful":10,"user_id":"_vy7K2Q9X8p7Jl1OkY_JOQ","date":"2012-09-08"},{"cool":0,"text":"Coffee torte is awesome.

The mini plates, baskets and mini pots add a personal touch to your dining experience. The selections are decent on weekdays, but selections are more on weekends. I think it's safe for me to say that's the case for most buffets in town. So, do expect to pay more on weekends.\n\nThe meat and seafood are above average in taste and quality.

Since I wanted to take advantage of that $22 brunch from 10a to 2p, I got here around noon.  If I arrived any earlier, I wouldn't have been hungry enough to sample a lot of their offerings.\n\nIn the end I took care of 5 plates, when including dessert.  On my first place, I piled up salad, fruit, a chicken salad slider, and shrimp cocktail (that come in plastic containers resembling shot glasses).  Then I got up to head towards the warm food area.  On my next 3 plates, I went with their chicken, pork, mac & cheese, korean ribs, fried rice, chow mein, and even threw in some bacon for good measure.  I know I had more than that, but I packed those ribs on twice and there were some other things I wanted to try, but didn't get to.  \n\nAnd for dessert, I went with strawberry balsamic gelato, a chocolate covered strawberry, and a macaroon.  If I had taken a look at the dessert area first, I probably would have cut back something else from that of my previous 3 plates. I wanted a lot more gelato flavors, since they have what looked like well over a dozen!  My advice: practice some self-discipline, take small portions, you can always have more of something later if you like it a lot.  As for me, I obviously had little self-control.\n\nWhen I left around 1:30, the line outside was huge.

Start at the left with appetizers and salads, and work your way to the right, ending you with a vast array of fudge and other decadent sweets.\n\nIt is very nice that most of the items are individually portioned. But even with the small portions, I didn't actually finish any of the dishes because I wanted to make sure I could try everything. And the crab claws already opened and in little saucers with cocktail sauce, nice touch! The salads were fantastic. The breads, not that great. The kobe beef shoulder, yum! Also the truffle scalloped potato, delicious! There was a select few items I did not care for, but I don't even remember it. I read notes that someone mentioned the braised short ribs and they were as expected, tender and flavorful!\n\nI didn't try much from the pizza/pasta or asian section. I had to save room for desserts!\n\nI loved their selection for ice cream. I tried the coconut lime and the pb&j. Both were yummy with a little tiny cone I used as a scooper :)\n\nAlso note the amazing quantity of large chocolate covered strawberries, some plain, some white chocolate, some with nuts, some with oreos, etc. Also mini chocolate dipped apples! YUMMY!\n\nAnd then there were crepes, which I didn't get a chance to try. Cookies there were really good. Strongly alcoholic tiramisu cups. Other sweets that were too sweet. Overall, though great place with a nice selection. A close second to Wynn Buffet IMO, but for the price, I might come here more often.\n\nOur server, I can't remember her name, but she was very sweet and everyone worked together to make sure we had enough room on our table for new plates as we eat very quickly and create a ton a dishes. Good job.\n\nOne thing, The buffet is such a long walk from the rest of the restaurants. If you go up the escalator/elevator by the chandelier, you gotta walk through a long hallway passing by 2 large high heel shoes and another quiet hall to finally reach the buffet at the end.

I was very excited to come here after looking at pictures on Yelp but ended up feeling underwhelmed. Let's start with the positives: presentation. I like that Wicked Spoon understands the concepts of small plates. A lot of the hot food was placed in small iron skillets and bowls, which made it look exciting to look at. The point of a buffet, at least to me, is to sample a little bit of everything it has to offer. Small portions are genius because it allows me to try everything, and then go back for seconds if I like it. Another aspect I really liked was dessert, namely the chocolate-covered strawberries and gelato.\n\nMost of the food I had was disappointing. The mac n cheese was so-so, the crab legs had an oddly bitter taste (from the lemon?), and the salad was drenched in dressing. I didn't try the cakes but the BF said it wasn't good. Bottom line: I didn't find myself going back for seconds. One thing I did really like was the cauliflower puree.

Upon arrival i was surprised to see no line on a Sunday evening (wut!) and so i was seated in 2 minutes and onto the food. \nWill my server nice dude, friendly smile (no homo), and good personality took my drink order and said get your grub on which i was prepared to do. Did the stroll over the food which as promised served individually on about 80% of the offerings down to the salads which honestly were a nice highlight with the interesting varieties. Everything was clean, well presented and seemed to be prepared with a little more thought in terms of flavor with items such as chorizo enfuesed salmon, braised short ribs, and even a mac n cheese bar which was certainly a first for me. Even with all the eye candy of the food it was unfortunately lacking in flavor just like your typical buffet food that i have experienced. The carving station salmon and chicken were dry as the Mojave. The mac n cheese station was too much cheddar, can you say cheese with a side of noodle. And i think what stood out most for the night of negatives was the very bitter flavored lamb ribs on the Asian station that seemed almost like a black bean coating of some sort. \nOf course its not all bad, highlights were the ceviche although needing more shrimp still very fresh and flavorful, the interesting salad combinations, the leg of lamb on the carving station, the braised short rib, and the desert bar was stellar. Fudge oh so creamy, the choco strawberries everybody is talking about and i especially liked the peanut butter cookies that had something like chopped reece's cup sprinkled on top. \nYou know in the end there is just far better food in this city to be had for $30 a head at dinner. I mean if your mission is to stuff your face to the point where it hurts your tummy then have at it here at Wicked Spoon sure. But your dollars can have better quality food at many of great restaurants on the strip and easily be satisfied with a good meal and service at the same price if not cheaper depending where you go. Im by no means a food snob but at $30 a head id like some quality over just a nice presentation. \nOh and one other big plus is the rest room inside the actual buffet i noticed.

Wicked Spoon might lose in the selection department over others, but focuses on quantity, quality, & one essential but oft overlooked criteria: FLAVOR. \n\n::: [ TECHNIQUE ] :::\n\nDue to preparation of large batches, many buffets (including Wynn's, which I haven't been back to in 2+ yrs) tend to offer food with less desirable textures due to being left out for too long and/or imperfect cooking temperatures, Wicked Spoon rarely makes that mistake.\n\n::: [ PRESENTATION ] ::: \n\nPerfectly portioned little bowls/plates. Reduces chance of cross-contamination by other guests and things being mixed around on your own plate. Maintains presentation - consistency in plating technique is a 3.5/5 - 4/5 depending on the station & dish.\n\n::: [ SERVICE ] ::: \n\nOnly experienced poor service 2 out of 7 times.

Seriously, the steamship pork they were carving, miso glazed pork loin, char siu, pork belly steam buns were all tasty and perfectly cooked. Pork is usually a buffet fail, but these are juicy and perfectly cooked. The steamship with a bit of the onion marmalade and chimichurri was worth a 2nd carving. The other meats like the turkey, kalbi ribs and linguica was good too. If I just want to sit and gorge on meat, I would consider going here for $22 than go to a Brazilian rodizio for $40. \n\nSalad- I know, it's just an effing salad but buratta cheese with crushed pistachio served with frisee in red wine raspberry vinaigrette is a winner.\n\nGelato- plenty flavors and well made\n\nDecent- cured pepper salmon, cheeses, farro tabuleh, goat cheese roasted tomato salad, creamy polenta with mushrooms, pizza, clams in a stew (but they really should have just left them plain in butter since the clams were fresh but the sauce isn't good), already peeled shrimp cocktail. \n\nNow onto the fails- \n\nThe concept of little serving plates seem cute and different, but it simply doesn't work especially on the items they are doing. Covered or not, these are items that shouldn't sit so they really need to consider thats in them. They also seriously need to give you like a cafeteria tray. Two of them fill a plate. Risotto- seriously? Rice seizes into itself and gets mushy. Gnochi turns into a gummy mess like a mochi. Cappelli pasta looked mushy so I didn't even try. Mac n cheese got hard on the top. Seafood like poached cod was gross. \n\nDesserts were very pretty but some were spit out worthy. Gelato was the best thing there with plenty of flavors and good consistency. This little mousse chocolate cup was decent, the strawberries dipped in chocolate were sweet. I saw macarons with fruit and I was expecting them to not be great, but they were inedible. It tasted like the purple food coloring and rusted chlorinated water. Some desserts didn't even make fucking sense like a very tart mango puree with chocolate mouse and pearls and fruit jelly on top. This was where the majority of food wastage was since a lot of it wasn't any good. I rather have a big bowl of ugly looking bread pudding from Sams Town buffet than aesthetically pleasing but palette scaring desserts. \n\nService was alright. Plates didn't sit so long, but we didn't get many plates for the time we sat around. I like that they do give you water for the table since sometimes you just need something to drink and don't have anything. They weren't bad on the refills of my tea though. \n\nIt's not a buffet I would recommend for that pricepoint, but I suppose it wasn't terrible. I'm a pork meat person so the large amount of pork cooked right was a definite win. Maybe if I had tourist friends going there anyways, I wouldn't mind going, but I do not think it's a place I'd seek out.","review_id":"R23IHhGx3b-aDYKRrRPofA","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":12,"useful":9,"user_id":"n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew","date":"2011-04-11"},{"cool":3,"text":"\"Eh\" is all I have to say.\n\nLocated inside the Cosmopolitan hotel next to Rose. Rabbit. Lie. We came here for my bf's bday dinner. $38 per person, $56 if you wanted unlimited wine or beer. There was no line on a Wednesday night so we were seated in about 10 minutes. \n\nThe layout is beautiful. Warm and inviting. There were crystal decorations hanging from the ceiling throughout the restaurant. There's even a glass jar of water at your table so you won't have to ask the server for more water refills. Our server's name was Vladimir and he was on top of his game. Clearing our used plates and refilling our iced teas. \n\nThe food on the other hand was the reason for the low stars. They offer small portions, which is great because then you get to sample everything instead of loading up on certain things. For some reason, I ended up eating a lot of salads. A wedge salad, Cesar salad, beats salad, papaya salad, ceviche (kind of a salad)...you get the picture.  The salads were very fresh and flavorful though. I just wasn't blown away by the actual hot food items. The only hot food items I remember picking up were tacos, chicken wings, bone marrow, and soup. Nothing stood out as \"omg I need to get more of this.\" And the chicken wings smelled like arm pit. The bf did enjoy the prime rib and spicy sausage. \n\nAs for the dessert bar, very underwhelming. They had chocolate covered strawberries, macarons, gelato and a few other pastries. I tried everything since I have the biggest sweet tooth. I felt bad because almost all the desserts I picked up went to waste. I took one bite and didn't like any of it. I have to say I did enjoy the chocolate covered strawberries and the pistachio gelato. I even got seconds of them. \n\nAll in all, I like trying new places to eat.

It's definitely a few giant steps up from many other resort buffets in town. Atmosphere is wonderful. Service is great. They labeled any dish containing nuts, which we appreciated since one in our party was allergic.

Plus, it's hard not to like unlimited bacon.\n\nThe meat carving station had a decent variety, but they didn't have normal prime rib. They use a different cut of beef, which tastes fine, but it's no prime rib. My kids and husband loved those beef slices with the creamy mashed potatoes. I liked the pasta and lamb lasagna at the Italian station. I'd suggest skipping most of the Asian food section as it was disappointing. Very dry sushi. At dinner, the made-to-order seafood (choice of scampi or bouillabaisse) was probably my favorite thing, followed by the little greek and caprese salads. \n\nDessert station had a nice selection. I found the taste to be hit or miss, but my husband really enjoyed all of the offerings he tried for dessert, especially the cheesecakes. I liked the gelato. I tried so many flavors. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend this place as a good value.

Wicked Spoon is one the first hotels to serve individually plated food items to prevent extra food waste. It's great for the environment and cleaner in my opinion. \n\nFOOD: They have multiple stations that feature cuisines from around the world. The first station is the sushi (they have both rolls and tuna/salmon/yellow tail sashimi), then Asian (curry, fried rice, dim sum buns, etc.), American (there's a tomato and friend eggplant mix that I highly recommend you to try), Italian (squid ink pasta, kale pasta, etc.), prime rib and other juicy meat options, salad bar, and a few more stations that I don't remember the names of. \n\nDESSERT: I am making dessert its' own category because I am seriously blown away with their dessert station. It's not your average cookies, ice cream, cakes, and pudding. When I ate on a Thursday afternoon, they served a mango & passionfruit zenith cake (a fluffy marshmallow texture dessert with a fruit jelly substance inside), vegan coconut tapioca with mango (my favorite), the moistest carrot cake ever, and the best gelato ever (I highly recommend the mango & passion fruit and blood orange gelatos). I had like 3 or 5 plates of dessert and I am not ashamed at all LOL. \n\nOVERALL: Cosmo is my favorite hotels and it makes sense that their buffet is also the best on the strip.

They had 3 different types of cheeses (sake & espresso dusted) with cold cuts, a meat section with sausage, prime rib, lamb, some chicken, chicken wings, fried chicken basket, pho station, seafood soup station, a very small selection of Asian food but they did have pork belly!, a few different types of pizzas, crab legs, a small salad section and a few others that I didn't take a look at. \n\nI think the thing that stood out most was their seafood soup station. You can build your own, add the level of spiciness and whatever seafood you wanted... they had shrimp, scallops, clams, and some type of white fish. It was pretty good, but don't fill up on it too much! \n\n4/5 on the prime rib. Don't let it get cold, because it tasted pretty tough, even though I got a medium rare cut. \n\n2/5 french onion. cute presentation, a bunch of cheese, but wayyy too salty! \n\ncrab legs were crab legs... if you want them heated up, just let the guys know and they'll do it for you. \n\n5/5 freshly made guacamole next to the tacos! \n\nI didn't touch the sushi, but they didn't look very good. Small selection of about 4 different types. Same thing goes for the pizza...\n\n1/5 pho. Build your own, but noodles were undercooked, broth didn't taste very good either. \n\n5/5 duck wings/legs were SUPER tasty, well seasoned, and so soft that they just fell right off the bone. \n\n1/5 Shrimp ceviche in a coconut sauce but I didn't taste any coconut. \n\n5/5 Spinach dip, use the hummus at the cold cut/salad station to eat with it!\n\n5/5 Bone marrow with a crunchy topping\n\n5/5 mac n cheese\n\nI liked the dessert selection, but felt that it was again, pretty small. I got the thai tea gelato and white chocolate coffee gelato which were delicious. The mango passionfruit cake was also good, had a hint of coconut in it I think.

The Chefs there have plans to roll out a seasonal menu starting Easter, while continuing to serve the some core items throughout the year, so guests can experience the food at Wicked Spoon without getting bored of the same menu.\n\nAbout the service, I think it is excellent.  The waiters/waitresses are all doing their best to offer a great service to the guest.  And if you have special dietary needs, you can ask the cooks and they will do their best to accommodate you.  If you have other special requests (i.e., craving for a specialty cheese that may not be on displayed at the buffet, wanting to have your prime rib grilled), from personal experience I know they will accommodate you.  Which is major kudos in my book.\n\nAnyway, for the price of admission, I think you are getting a pretty decent value and food here.  4 stars!\n\nAnd if you have the Cosmopolitan IDENTITY card, present it to the cashier to accumulate points towards the rewards program.\n\n---Promotions---\nOn \"Plateau\" Mondays, guests can upgrade their dinner with a Fruits de Mer Seafood Plateau served directly at your table for only $10 per person. Minimum of 2 people.","review_id":"VzJq4PjEeCgDvrjCA_Ft0w","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":5,"useful":16,"user_id":"RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA","date":"2011-04-19"},{"cool":13,"text":"I generally avoid buffets like the plague!

We showed up around 7:30 on a Tuesday night.  There was a bit of a line but it appeared to be moving fast so we just went with the flow.   Well, we found out this was just the line to pay!  After you paid you get into another line which was 30-45 minutes long!  Talk about your FAKE OUT!   A few things they need to add - first, a sign stating how long the wait is or at least tell us before we plop down $50/person.   While we were finishing up our transaction, a guest from the VIP line (which you can pay extra for if you want to skip the line.  Kind of like Universal Studio's Front of the Line pass)  was upset his party hadn't been seated yet.  They told him it was a 20 minute wait.   I would have been cranky to pay and extra $10 or $15/person (I think that was the upgrade) and still wait 20 minutes.  \n\nI felt bad for the 2 families of 5 in front of us.  All they had in the dining room was tables for 4 that they could 'squeeze' another chair in.  It was that or they could wait longer for larger table.  They both took the table for 4 as I'm sure they were cranky about waiting as well.  \n\nWhen we finally got to our seat (around 8:30ish).   The bottle of water was almost empty so we asked for another one.  The hostess basically stole one from another table and placed our empty one on it.  It took a while for someone to take our drink order, but they did arrive quickly after that.  \n\nThe food was actually pretty good, but it might be because we were starving.  The seafood was spot on and the Jerk Chicken was tender and moist.  Great job there.  For us though, the surprise wait was the kicker that basically put us in a bad mood for the evening.

I really liked the shrimp cocktail which comes in shotglasses with the cocktail sauce in them already. The tritip was pretty good too!

So we paid about $44 for this place. \n\nNow if I'm paying that much for the a buffet, I at least expect some decent service. Our hostess took our bill and said they would set up our table. We waited.. and waited.. and waited. No one came back for us for at least 20 minutes. There were obviously open tables everywhere throughout the restaurant, yet we haven't been seated yet. It was ridiculous. We even saw our table set up but no one had come for us. Finally, we had to flag down our hostess and she took us to our table, apologizing that she 'forgot' about us or thought someone had taken care of it. UGHHHHH!\n\nEven after we sat down, throughout the night, our waiter was kind of inattentive and MIA. We had to flag him down several times to get our drink orders and didn't look so happy to be here. I mean, yeah, we already paid 18% gratuity, but it was just ridiculous... tsk tsk Wicked Spoon. I don't endorse that message. \n\nBut besides the service, the food does save my review. The prime rib was bomb and the assortment of hot dishes were great. I enjoyed the Asian section a lot, per usje. Loved that there was a DIY Mac n Cheese station. Love that cheesiness. My favorite part of the buffet was the dessert bar! 16 flavors of gelato/ice cream, cheesecake, bread pudding, chocolate cake, chocolate-dipped strawberries.

The outside was dry rubbed in heaven!\n\nDinner - 3 Stars\nDinner on a Friday night was lackluster. It was way pricier. I was disappointed they didn't have the chicken wings or fatty bacon. I was in fact very sad. The dishes were hit or miss here. Some were dry because it was left on the heat lamps for too long. Some were great. The Korean BBQ was on the dry side.\n\n-Bone marrow - It's a giant beef bone cut in half and full of bone marrow. Might gross many people out, but I loved it.\n\n-Dessert - All the dessert was yummy!

Cute litle mini chocolate cones filled with pudding.  \n\nOn the other hand, the thing I hate most about this place [seems to be the  thing most people love about this place], is the fact that most dishes are served on individual plates or little pots. In most buffets, only the desserts such as cake or pie are served on individual platters. \n\nWhy do I hate this? Simply put - I can't fit as much on my plate. When I go to buffets - my plan of action is to usually get a little bit of a lot of food to kind of feel the place out. Which is, definitely something I couldn't do here. You can only grab about 3 small plates at a time. Which means you have to get up from your table more often. I guess, this could be construed as a good thing - as it provides a little more exercise to negate some of the thousands of calories you will have consumed by the end of the meal.

So, I was disappointed by the fact that this buffet did not offer the same. But, that could just be me being spoiled. =p\n\nSo, like I said - definitely a love/hate relationship.

If you didn't care for what you tried, you could go back for something else.\n\nThe room is beautiful as well, and the $50/pp cost seemed reasonable to us, considering the variety - you could have a 4-course meal, and the desserts were out of this world -- again, small and manageable to try a bunch.\n\nService was good, plates were always cleaned off the table by the time you got back from another round.\n\nThey also have a \"take out\" option for $20, which is kinda nice if you are staying in the hotel and just want to camp out on your fabulous balcony and enjoy the view of the Strip.\n\nWe would go to Wicked Spoon again, regardless of whether we were staying at the Cosmo, definitely a nice dinner option, or maybe we will try for brunch next time.","review_id":"z7h8-sReylWt-GgfjCgo0w","stars":5,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"uJqy8uK0js_OGkBgOi1WSg","date":"2014-05-08"},{"cool":1,"text":"Fine for a buffet, I guess.

I would rather pay more to get higher quality food made to order instead of sitting under heat lamps for hours with people walking by and coughing in their general direction. That said, this is one of the least bad buffets I have ever been to, the other one that still exists being the Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace. There's also the one that no longer exists, the Rio seafood buffet BEFORE it started to suck (back in the early 2000s; I got married and brought my husband years later but all the seafood smelled and tasted totally rancid) -- since it sucks now, I can't count that one anymore.\n\nSo which to choose? Depends on what you want. The Asian food was better at Bacchanal, while the Wicked Spoon's Asian food was terrible. Bacchanal has some small selection of okay dim sum and made-to-order noodles (udon, ramen, pho, and even laksa, which I haven't seen at a buffet before). The Wicked Spoon had better prime rib and other cutting station meats, and had ribeye steak, which Bacchanal does not have. Both have lots of tiny cute desserts, but Bacchanal has daan tat (Chinese egg custard tarts). They had a puff pastry shell instead of the usual crust which is like a cross between puff pastry and harder, shortbread-like pie crust.\n\nThe best things Wicked Spoon had to offer were the wicked fried chicken (spicy fried chicken in mini baskets), the ribeye, mini shrimp cocktails, and the made-to-order paella-like seafood station.\n\nThey made us wait and seated several parties behind us first, which was kind of annoying especially considering how long we had already been waiting by then. It was also on the late side by the time we got seated (less than an hour before closing, even though we got there before 8pm), and while no one rushed us, I still felt a bit rushed as they were doing quite a bit of cleanup all around us 20 minutes into our meal, and they started taking food off the buffet line. I had to run around and grab a bunch of stuff and dump it at the table in order for us to grab some things before the opportunity was taken away.\n\nFinally, like I said about Bacchanal, to me it's worth going just once to experience it, but like all the high-end buffets costs more money than it's worth, and is also not worth the hour and a half wait it took us on a late weekday night.\n\nNow we only have one more buffet to cross off our Vegas buffet list, the Sterling champagne brunch, and then I never have to eat at another buffet for as long as I live.","review_id":"bPZU2U4tHWtqmT91BMmFRw","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"SkGhMBBRcvKq3bwjcjbs_w","date":"2016-12-23"},{"cool":0,"text":"I don't know what happened to this place.

There were a lot of Japanese businessmen sitting next to me and they were all ranting in Japanese how bad it was throughout my meal too.

It ruined my Las Vegas vacation and the days after.\n\nI will never be returning to Wicket Spoon.

Crispy, sweet, tart, and refreshing.\n\nBone Marrow - Seriously... definitely a hidden gem! So good, but so bad for you.  It's ok because we are all on vacation here!\n\nDuck Ravioli - I would have loved this, but because it just sits under a heat lamp, the sauce thickened greatly.\n\nBraised Beef/Pot Roast - Super tender and flavorful! Just imagine some good ol' pot roast.  \n\nCarrot Cake - Dessert selections generally are typically sub pay, however this was a very standard, but good carrot cake.\n\nThai Tea Gelato - They sure did not hold on on the thai tea in this.

Meaty, juicy, tender... \n\nOVERALL:  Came here with a party of 37 and the staff was so genuine and kind.  Again, I tried EVERYTHING they had to offer.  It's what you do at a buffet!

It's a very clean and inviting restaurant.  It's atmosphere is so comfortable that you can come casual in you workout gear, or decked-out for the evening without feeling out of place.  The service here is very attentive and perhaps the best I've experienced at a buffet.  The waitstaff often checks in to see how you are doing and takes away plates promptly once you are finished.  The buffet stations are always clean which is probably attributed to the fact that all of the items are in its own dish.  \n\nAside from the service, decor, and atmosphere... the food here is the star.  Of course, there are your normal favorites just as every other Las Vegas buffet.  Crab legs, jumbo shrimp, prime rib, and racks of lamb.  But there are also delicate specialties such as salmon and risotto, spaghetti and veal meatballs, and a mac & cheese bar.  The quality and preparation of each dish is comparable to that you would expect with fine-dining restaurants.  I don't have anything negative to say about my experience with Wicked Spoon.

I still waited about 30 minutes, but really that's to be expected with this buffet because there's so many people swarming to try it out.  Anyways, this time the service was a bit better.  The food selection for the breakfast was WAY better than lunchtime.  There were much more familiar choices yet they were perfected and so great to eat.  Nothing tasted too overly salty or sweet towards the end.  The apple sausage was great and I really liked their fried chicken wings as well (chicken wings for breakfast, Yeah!).  Anyhow, I guess they had some time to perfect their execution of this buffet.  I'm gladly giving them four stars.  I would aim for a five but the waiting time is a little too disorganized.","review_id":"CWHFNaC6U2Bcddfw6-mrgQ","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":4,"user_id":"De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw","date":"2011-08-08"},{"cool":0,"text":"Definitely a high end buffet.

I was getting so many referrals about this place, that I had to try it with my friends and family (who've all been dying to try the spot out as well).\n\nThis buffet is located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel/Casino!! Dinner was $22 if I can recall? It was 18% more for each of us because of the larger party (they charge gratuity with a party of 6 or more fyi)\n\nSo, one of the cool things I loved & learned was that they have their own water well, so their water comes in this beautiful glass bottle, and you serve yourself (which is convenient for me because I absolutely love H2O!) I asked the beverage server what was so great about the water, and he said that the water is purified 3 times! No wonder it felt like the best water I've ever tasted!\n\nAnother part to this experience was the beauty of it all.  The food looked like the type of food you'd find on the food channel. It was more of the gourmet-type dishes, and the presentation of it all was an A-plus! I loved how the dishes were served in little pots =). The chandeliers & paintings on the walls were creative too!\n\nThere were a variety of good dishes, but only some Great dishes. One of the best parts of the buffet was the mac&cheese bar, where you were to choose the ingredients, type of cheese, and macaroni shells.  The chef was absolutely hilarious & made my mac&cheese just the way I liked, which was also a good thing.\n\nAnd so the desserts... there were plenty of tarts, and cups of many pleasant sweets, but the best in the dessert-end (if I had to choose) would be the white chocolate covered strawberries, even though it wasn't so original. \n\nHowever... try this place out if you're curious, be prepared to eat your money's worth, and bring friends =D","review_id":"FhCJwAyXWSsfy8X1fousjw","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":10,"useful":11,"user_id":"udpfGxriuoBdWRBdplJl-w","date":"2011-04-26"},{"cool":2,"text":"I was hoping for amuse-bouche, but instead I got big little bowls of bleh.  If you want to sell food for more money, you give it a fancy name, and people will perceive it as delicious, because it's expensive.  But remove the pricing from your perception, and this buffet is just another pile of food you can get anywhere else.\n\nWe went Saturday at 6pm and the line was surprisingly short. The waitress was very friendly and the table was cleared often, until the end when we went for dessert and the dinner plates never left, even for the half hour we sat talking over coffee.  But these things do not go into my rating, because I went there for the food, after seeing enough friends posts on Facebook that this place rules.\n\nUnfortunately, I was underwhelmed. For this kind of money, I would rather go to Paris, Wynn, Bellagio, Mirage, or even Yama Sushi for AYCE.\n\nI was frustrated with the tapas-style portions of food, because I don't want eight gnocci in a bowl of lamb sauce -- let me pick out one noodle to taste first and then I'll decide if I want a whole serving.  I don't want a cup of fries to go with my fish n chips -- I just want a piece of fried fish. So many things I wanted just a taste, but were only served in portions that meant a table full of wasted food.  Am I the only weirdo who walks around the buffet first gathering literally ONE BITE of things, and then I go back to get more of what I liked?\n\nWe finally figured out the key is to share the first round of bowls with the whole table, so everyone gets a taste and then goes to get what they liked for themselves.\n\nThe second frustration was that things kept running out.  My friends would bring back dishes, I'd go up to get some, and they were gone.  I never saw the prime rib, and the pork shoulder I got instead had five-spice on it, which I loathe.  The crab was served in open shells, which probably explains why it was so watery and void of flavor.  The sushi was grocery store quality.  The bone marrow tastes like something my grandma would scrape out of her cast iron skillet before doing dishes.  It's funny how people run out of fancy ideas, so they circle back around to the garbage that used to be fit for peasants and leftovers, and they call it a triumph with a new price tag.  Chopping a dozen cherry tomatoes in a bowl with a crust of bread is a sad version of cheap-old bruschetta, and left me with a bowl of tomatoes to deal with when the bread ran out two bites in.\n\nThe best thing in the dessert area was the blood orange gelato, so sweet and tart.  The red velvet cookies were also lovely.  But there were no macaroons, my favorite thing on this planet, so I was super bummed the rumor turned out false.\n\nWe stuffed ourselves sick, and then enjoyed walking the Cosmo's hallways of beautiful art and people.

It seemed to be the perfect occasion to splurge on a buffet.  Of course for my very first meal, it had to be between Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon.  I had eaten at Bacchanal on my previous Vegas vacation, so by default - Wicked Spoon it was!  I was so thrilled to finally have the opportunity to try this elusive gluttonous foodie heaven.\n\nThe buffet is very pretty and tastefully decorated.  The servers are very friendly and attentive.  Unfortunately, the food was not memorable at all.  I wanted to love it so hard, but sadly, it did not live up to my expectations. I had 5 rounds at the buffet - yes 5!  I started off at the meat carving station - the beef roast was very good, but the asparagus was a little woody.  The thick cut bacon was not nearly as good as the bacon at Bacchanal - it was not even thick and there wasn't enough smokiness to it.  It just tasted like any regular pork belly.  Even though the beef was good, I decided that it did not warrant a return trip to the carving station.  I also had the fried chicken wings, which were decent, but not crispy enough.  Kinda under seasoned and the sauce selection was sadly very limited.  There was BBQ, ketchup, and something else.  You would think that a place like Wicked Spoon would be a little more creative and playful.\n\nFor round 2, I did the breakfast part of brunch - I had some carnitas benedict fusion dish - which was not very good - too salty and the carb (I forget the name of it) was far too hard to even cut - I didn't eat it.  The guac was good though, so at least there was that.  I also had the fruit cup, sriracha watermelon (weird), and watermelon-apple juice blend (which was not so flavorful and had me wishing that there were other juice options).  Once again, Bacchanal beats Wicked Spoon out here.  \n\nFor round 3, I had the oxtail \"pho\".  First of all, the noodles were not even pho.  They were a different type of thick Vietnamese rice noodles - called bun.  Not the same as pho - don't try to trick the customer, Wicked Spoon!  The broth was oxtail and wasn't made to order - there was a big vat of soup that you serve yourself.  The condiment bar for the pho was abysmal.  The  beansprouts, cilantro, and green herb (I don't know what it is called in English) were not fresh at all.  Some of the stuff was BROWN.  No bueno.  Also, it's very inaccessible, you really need to reach to get stuff and for me, it was a huge struggle.  However, gotta give them props for the phenomenal roasted bone marrow with crostini.  That was my favorite thing of the meal.  Absolutely delicious!  That was the only item that I came back to the buffet a second time for.\n\nFor round 4, I tried some of the Asian stuff - sushi (don't get it - it's all rice), pot stickers (good, but not worth wasting your calories on), some sort of sweet and sour chicken with rice (don't get - the rice was hard, the chicken was not hot), chicken wings (decent), and of course more bone marrow.  All in all, pass on the Asian section.\n\nFinally, round 5 consisted of desserts.  My fave was the carrot cake and gelato bar.  This was the only section that beat out Bacchanal I think.  Since I'm not a huge dessert person, I will not be returning to Wicked Spoon and instead I will be going to Bacchanal.\n\nWicked Spoon had good variety, pretty presentation of the food, and a delicious dessert bar.  But, most of the food, with the exception of the bone marrow, was unremarkable.  Was it worth the $40+ ($35 + tax, tip)?  Probably not, to be honest.  I think that money would be much better spent at Bacchanal.  I wanted to love Wicked Spoon especially since I have heard about it for years, but I just wasn't impressed.  Good food and plenty of variety, but nothing really WOWed.","review_id":"rg1uiC1jUOBXxKxN2Ao0Xw","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":2,"useful":2,"user_id":"kFYEp9HvN-yTStS7YD_bVQ","date":"2015-09-01"},{"cool":11,"text":"Wicked Spoon is indeed Wicked! \nShe pulled us in with her outstanding, beyond delicious, out of the world dinner, only to crush our spirits, abuse us, and kick us out the door with her Brunch. \nDinner Saturday night was AMAZING!

It was the pictures posted here that swayed us to go to Wicked Spoon. Everything looked good and there SEEMED like a lot of variety available.\n\nThis is why I took off another star.

Parking was easy enough and there were clear directions to the place which I love about the Cosmopolitan. \n\nWe came here after eating pizza and fries at the Palazzo pool but man this place sure knows how to toy with your will and break it down to nothing. We got there around 1:15 and were warned that the food will be taken away around 2:15! So we had just about an hour. (Btw, take them seriously, though a lot of people were still eating they did start cleaning up and taking away the food around 2:10)\n\nThe system was a little weird, after paying for your table, you get in a second line to be actually seated. Though there was no line to pay, there was a line to wait. It was so late for brunch but we still had to wait a good 15 minutes because there were 2 parties in front of us. But come on, it's a buffet! A large, popular one at that. Anyways our server was awesome and amazing; super excited to be working. He was just so happy it made me happy. Even when we asked for milk (which is kind of a strange request I guess, as we've found out like at the Wynn) he was like \"OKAY! :D\", like literally with the :D face. Our brunch ticket included a mimosa or a bloody mary each, and I was the only one who had her drink (a mimosa) which was pretty good! \n\nThe food was good but the presentation made it great!! They had the CUTEST little miniature pots and frying square mesh things. They also had the BEST dessert EVERRR. I was stuffed, and uncomfortably so. I tried a bunch of their chocolate-y desserts though, and the lava cake in caramel sauce was my favorite. It wasn't necessarily a lava cake because there wasn't any chocolate sauce in the middle, but it was such a light, fluffy cake that was super chocolate-y at the same time. I drool thinking about it. I also had the chocolate mousse cup which was just adorable in the chocolate shell, and also the tiramisu cup which was surprisingly very good as well. They also have chocolate covered strawberries with toffee sprinkled on top and by that time everything was just excessive. It was a good deal though $22 for a weekday brunch, I would definitely come back here, ESPECIALLY for the desserts!!!!!","review_id":"LqDS5niQk-pHuKVXQfHTBA","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":1,"useful":3,"user_id":"83hGjT-0qeA-x3wKM7X5Zw","date":"2012-08-18"},{"cool":1,"text":"About $38 for Saturday dinner, one of the cheaper buffet options on the strip... was it worth it?

Some items that we ate were an Indian curry, pad see ew noodles, dim sum, crab legs, prime rib, and pasta. The savory items in a nutshell were just okay, but what saved my dinner experience was the dessert offerings... gelato, tres leches, opera cake, mango passion fruit cake, carrot cake, cake cake cake... and pie!

It's located in the beautiful Cosmopolitan Hotel, and of course because of its location has a very trendy and chic feel to it. \n\nLike most buffets, this buffet is organized by cuisine --  salad, Chinese cuisine, sushi, pasta/pizza, and carvery items, but there is so much more to it than what most other buffets offer! Not only do they have your basics but they have a lot of specialty dishes like Kalbi ribs, pork belly buns, gnocchi, risotto, pork loin, beef stews, seared fish, even stations for noodle soups!! All the items are beautifully plated onto smaller cups/bowls/plates/dishes so that you can just grab and go! I think this is a great idea, because you really get the sense of detail the chefs put into their dishes and it really cuts down food waste. \n\nI know $30 sounds a bit steep for a lunch buffet, but honestly you won't find a better deal than that in Vegas... so why not spend it somewhere worthwhile? I've tried a few other buffets, and I think it's safe to say that Wicked Spoon is my favorite.","review_id":"SJk39I0O1u8SucPMSXiZmw","stars":5,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"x2-TP8fd4G0OqkgDyKt3IA","date":"2013-02-03"},{"cool":0,"text":"The only reason not 5 stars is I've been there a few times and the food is slowly declining.  Often new buffets are great when they open, they get a good reputation and then start cutting.  I'm praying this doesn't happen here.\n\nFirst off, they are one of the first to care about presentation.  I don't mean of the space, I mean the food.  I think it is so smart the way that they serve each option in it's own little dish.  If you want shrimp it is served in a shot glass with 2 shrimp and a little cocktail sauce.  Yes, this means you can't really pile up a plate full of shrimp 2 miles high with a mound of cocktail sauce on top.  At the same time, do we really need that, and this presents so much better.  You can have as many shot glasses as you like, but it makes more sense for cost controls from their side, and it is better presentation altogether.  That goes for most of their food. \n\nI also like this from a cleanliness factor.  I own a small Italian restaurant in town, and one of the things I hate about buffet's is the fact that everyone else is sticking their hands into food that we're all eating.  The way that Wicked Spoon presents their food stops a lot of this from happening.  Each person gets their own little portion so they don't get their dirty hands in everyone else's food.  Very smart on many levels","review_id":"6bQhutm9Idut_dB94wgr0A","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"3MO--ENqKScLFQFuW1751g","date":"2012-04-27"},{"cool":0,"text":"I wanted to love it but I just didn't.

For months now I have been mourning the fact that I rarely get to go to M Resort's Studio B because of next to no options for my vegetarian wife - my experience at The Wicked Spoon has made me forget all about it.\n\nFirstly, if you're a vegetarian like my wife, don't worry about some reviews you see here saying that there's nothing for vegetarians - you'll be more than fine. There's a stack of options for everyone and even the things that you would consider \"sides\" are quite incredible. By \"vegetarian\" here I mean ACTUAL vegetarian, not the \"vegetarians\" who \"eat fish or chicken\".\n\nNow, on to the main body of the review. We had no idea this buffet even existed. I had always thought The Cosmopolitan was yet another tower of condos, but it's a fully fledged casino with restaurants and everything.\n\nThis buffet is much different from anything you've seen in Vegas before. There are no giant troughs of food to scoop from here, but individual portions in little pans and covered pots. Most of the time when I go to a buffet I end up eating a lot of about two or three things that I find I like - here EVERYTHING was great. Leek Bread Pudding? A SAVOURY bread pudding? I hate the dessert version of this dish, but this was awesome. I'd never even heard the word \"succotash\" before this meal unless is was preceded by the word \"suffering\" in a Warner Brothers cartoon, but this was great. How are -vegetables- \"great\" on a buffet? \n\nThere were so many things to see and try here that looked different and interesting that by the time I had loaded up on all my swag the first things I had taken were cold. Next time I think I'll get one thing at a time.\n\nMy only lament is that they don't let you go home for a few hours before you tackle dessert, because the options here are impressive ,too, with a great gelato station, huge chocolate-covered strawberries, an assortment of mini chocolate desserts, mousses, cookies and even some jazzed-up peanut butter cups and Kit-Kats.\n\nAt 35 bucks per head for dinner this place isn't cheap, but it's a real experience. I've found myself extremely burned out with buffets over the past year or so, but Wicked Spoon has really thrown me a curveball. It's a different concept with interesting choices beyond the standard buffet fare. Even if you usually avoid buffets, this place is different enough that you have to try it for yourself.\n\nDefinitely the best buffet on the main Strip area and quite possibly the best in the valley.","review_id":"EK4GanH1D4p5iHiFR3oK_w","stars":5,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":1,"useful":4,"user_id":"U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g","date":"2011-05-14"},{"cool":1,"text":"We tried this place on Monday for lunch due to all of the awesome Yelp reviews.\nIt was good, very good in fact.  $25 for \"brunch\" is not all that bad for Vegas, it comes with one mimosa.  It is really quite cool.  All items are served \"individually\", meaning a small portion on a small plate (but you can go back again and again).  I liked this as it would stop some of those gluttons from wasting so much food.  Each item is presented very nicely with accompaniments to go with it.  I liked it.\n\nThe good:  Very fresh, 5-star, chef quality food.\nThe breakfast items were very good and some out of the \"normal\" (good fresh sausages, apple, linguica, bangers, italian, etc.  all homemade).\nThe hash was excellent, benedicts good, omelet bar had good choices.\nAmazing hollendaise sauce on the benedicts and hash. mmmmm.\nPizza (only two types)  was very good.\nThe meatballs were very good.  Polenta with pesto, pancetta and cranberry good.\nThe desserts (although not as huge as some other LV buffets) were good.\nThe gelatos were AMAZING.  Chocolate covered strawberries also very fresh.\n\nThe \"meh\":  The beef selections.  No prime rib (I thought kind of weak), I did not try the sirloin, it looked good but not enough for me to try.  That was it.\nSome baked chicken that the wife said was \"ok\".\nThe \"angry mac and cheese\" tasted like Chef Boy Ardee (someone said you gotta try it, so I did).\nChocolate lava cake at the dessert bar was very dried out, like a brownie.\n\nThe needs some help:  Salad bar was seriously lacking.  There were only a couple of selections, some not too popular.  The popular ones (a nice looking wedge salad) was gone before I even had a chance to try and not replaced.  Then replaced with a watermelon salad that looked like, uh... cubes of watermelon.\nThe entire Asian section was weak (the little chinese to-go containers) and not even worth visiting.\nSeafood.  Oh, was there any?  A shot glass with 2 shrimp and a drop of cocktail sauce does not make a seafood bar.\n\nWhat would be good to add:  Prime rib.  Seafood. Get rid of the Asian stuff, improve the salads.  Maybe add a greek area instead (gyros, pita, hummus, cabbage rolls, souvlaki, etc).\nA crepe bar would be nice to see.\n\nWill we go back the next time?

This may be a buffet for folks who prefer small plates formats and who like to have interesting vegetarian, even vegan, options in the mix. \n\nWhat we found when we tried Wicked Spoon during a June trip to Las Vegas, was it worked for us for a one time stop. Whether we'll go back or not on another visit, can't say because overall there are things about buffets that give us heartburn, no matter how good the quality of the food. (If you want to know what that is, jump to end of review.) \n\nBut we're glad we tried Wicked Spoon once to see what all the buzz was about. Overall we think it lived up to its Yelp billing. Here's our summary assessment. \n\nService: 5 \nAmbiance (as buffets go): 5 \nFood (as buffets go): 4 \nValue (as the Las Vegas Strip goes): 4 \n\nHere's what we enjoyed when we went for brunch on a weekday. (Breakfast / brunch / lunch format goes from morning opening to sometime in later afternoon when it transitions to dinner.) \n\nSERVICE: Ultra friendly, as with almost all service in The Cosmopolitan. Top notch. From check in to purchase your pass to seating at the table, to the folks at the food stations. \n\nAMBIANCE: Not your normal buffet setting for seating ambiance. See photos. In particular when in The Cosmopolitan anywhere in the facility look up! The lighting fixtures are diverse and interesting throughout. Including here. \n\nVALUE: The cost is higher than many others in Las Vegas. For those who want to chow down on the $14.99 breakfast buffet at Flamingo (where our relatives were on this morning), the idea of $22 and change (brunch / $30+ for dinner) for a buffet at The Cosmopolitan may seem too much to consider. From our view, you get what you pay for in food quality and options. \n\nLIMITED CROWDS IF YOU TIME IT RIGHT: There was a good sized line on the Monday morning when we first went. So we skipped it and went back at about 10:30 am on Tuesday and walked right in. Our advice - time it to skip the lines...because if they're not there at check in, they won't be there for the food service either! \n\nUNIQUE FOOD: As much as this has small plate formats for some of the items, served in little covered casseroles, there are also open service bins for some things. But somehow the quantities in them suggest fresher food and less \"come on up to the trough to gorge yourself\" consumption. There is also a large carving station for those who enjoy roasted meat proteins. On the morning of our visit it seemed to include things like ham, pork belly, prime rib and so on. \n\nThe set up for the various food stations was as if visiting different continents or countries. \n\nThere were standard offerings too, like pancakes and omelets for the breakfast service, but we leaned to the unusual, which is our tendency. \n\nThings we tried and enjoyed were... \n...spicy tofu with red curry vegetables from the Asian / SE Asian section, \n...creamy polenta with wild mushrooms from the Italian / Mediterranean section, \n...the very best item of the day, a cauliflower puree with clementines and roasted cauliflower on top (we had seconds!),\n...plump Medjool dates with feta, \n...refreshing watermelon salad with cilantro and cucumber.\n...wicked good watermelon gazpacho,\n...beautiful fresh raspberries and blueberries. \n\nThe dessert bar, which was huge, included hundreds of petite sized pastries and also a gelato station. This was the disappointment for us. Although we liked the tiny sizes (like 2\" for pastries and maybe 2  oz for containers of panna cotta) the flavors in the fruit tart,  the meyer lemon panna cotta and lavender macaron we tried weren't stellar. \n\nBEVERAGES: Too funny that the brunch service is offered with a complimentary Mimosa, glass of champagne, or Bloody Mary but one has to pay for coffee. (Pretty decent coffee it is too.) \n\nWHY BUFFETS GIVE US INDIGESTION: Even at buffets like this, formatted to encourage reasonable consumption, some folks just can't break themselves of the practice of heaping plates with food and leaving half behind to go get another heaping plate to leave half behind. Different strokes for different folks, but this is why buffets, even pretty good ones like this, tend not to be our thing. I'd like to hand out a copy of Mr. Bloom's book: American Wasteland: How America Throws Away Nearly Half of Its Food...

I was gone for about 10 mins and the lady had just took our drink order as I arrived. My bf goes up to get his goodies and I wait for my iced tea, I'm super parched so I didnt wanna try anything just yet.

I'm not a fan of fish or seafood really so I was like dang! I did get some shrimp roll thing though. Then I went onto the hot tables with all the pots, I got the gnocchi, some truffle potatoes, some shrimp thingy, some meat, and green beans. I then went on and got a caesar salad because the other had tomatoes and I hate tomatoes!  Some cod (I think)  and some bread. I then went and sat to enjoy my finds!! \n\nWELL I try the gnocchi first, and to me it was too \"soft\" it felt slimy-ish. I've had gnocchi many times and this was the worst! It was super salty and just not yummy! I then went on to the beef,  which was hella hella bland! I've seriously had better beef at Applebees! I looked for a salt shaker to no avail, then our lady FINALLY brings our drinks and I have to ask her for one. The salt really didnt help, so I decided th bunch the meat with the green beans. Finally something yummy... kinda. The green beans were literally the best thing there. I did have to add salt and butter though. So I then try stuff I usually NEVER eat, like seafood. The cod (i think) was tasteless, and the shrimp roll was no bueno! \n\nI'm still hungry ok, and I have like 3 plates of food that were 1/4th eaten bc I wasnt pleased at all! So I go back to get some more green beans... I finally figured out were they had the mac n cheese station and was EXCITED! The cook was super nice and made my yummies, so back to my table I went. Well I tried it and was yet again not pleased! WTF?! I couldnt believe it! I was in shock! I finished my green beans and went off to the desert area.\n\nI got the choco strawberries, marshmallow, some red velvet log, some choc mousse cup thingy, and a fruit thing (sorry, I'm not a foodie!!)

I wanted to go back for more but my bf was pissed bc of the service (our server only checked on us 2wice and messed up our drink order) So we ended up leaving... STILL HUNGRY!\n\nOverall, the food is meh. Bland and tasteless IMO, the desert was totally yummy, and the service was shitty. I guess if I liked more of gourmet or had a wider palate I may like it, alas I do. I'm used to eating cheap and yummy so I'm ok with simple things. I may go back to try the brekkie or lunch, but who knows!

Why would you put the buffet so far away from the casino? How do you expect to get people to gamble?\n\nThe difference here is they serve everything on individual dishes. It causes you to grab less at a time, but you can eat as much as you want. They also close between lunch and dinner, so you can't pay for a late lunch, then stay around until dinner.\n\nFrom items like tacos to chicken salad sandwiches, they offer smaller portions so you can try a lot of different things. We did the lunch buffet for $22 and I liked it. \n\nI'd have to say, like most good buffets, one of the highlights was the desserts. They had this one parfait with peppermint cookies on top and strawberry jam on the bottom.

Well since it was way past closing time for this buffet, we decided to hit it up for brunch before we left town to go back home (le sigh).\n\nHere are some very helpful hints to getting ready for the massacre at the buffet! \n\n*A good brisk walk before is recommend to fully wake your stomach up and you as well. \n\n*Yes, wear your most loose fitting shirts and comfortable eating pants because unlike any other buffet in Vegas you stuff yourself silly and then go straight into a dessert coma after eating everything that you see. \n\n* Wicked Spoon is not location anywhere close to the main entrance; rather you have to zigzag to get here. Located past the two famous high-heeled shoes (yes I wanted to take the black one) you finally stumble upon this awesome place. \n\n* People it's a popular buffet in Vegas, so don't complain or whine that you have to stand in line, if it means that much to you then get up early and get your booty there.\n\n* And don't complain about the prices, would you rather have them charge you $10.00 for the buffet? At least paying a little more you know you get better quality food. However, if you want to spend less then I can suggest some rad buffets on Fremont Street (warning they are sketchy and I would not eat there unless you have a stomach made of steel).\n\n* After you devour everything in sight, dont go back to your hotel room to sleep it off, rather walk around the hotel. We did that and found The Kidrobot store and another store that was selling The Hundreds. \n\n\nWe arrived about an hour and a half before they stopped serving brunch (eek) no worried they told us, they do not start cleaning up until 2:15-2:30pm. \nBrunch is served from 8:00am-2:00pm (Monday-Friday) Their weekend hours are a wee more different. $ 22.00 gets you AYCE plus one Mimosa or Bloody Mary. \n\nOur hostess was nice as she took us to our table; this dining room was beautiful.

Plates were taken away pretty much as soon as you set them aside. \nI was hoping from the photos that I saw there would be more macarons but sadly the only ones I found were the sugar free with berries.

After reading these reviews and looking at the pictures I was beyond excited to go here.  We went on a Sunday night around 6:30 and waited in line about 30 minutes.  It was due to shortage of staff though, not the amount of people there.\n\nI had many things I was looking forward too and sadly most of them were not offered on Sunday nights.  There was plenty of options but I had my heart set on a few items that were not available.  The presentation is the best part of this buffet.  It is absolutely adorable.  Everything was prepared with such effort, you could just tell.\n\nSome of my favorite items include: lobster ravioli, Chinese noodle salad, cioppino, and the salty peanut gelato.  My least favorite were the dried up Chinese dishes and the crab legs.  Def do not go here for the crab legs, they were small and not very tasty.\n\nI doubt I will come back, while it was reasonably priced there are just too many other places in Vegas!","review_id":"aEZCjJkT2x3Z-PBdALvEWg","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":1,"useful":1,"user_id":"z72bj7TDPCi0Sovmsm4KOw","date":"2012-03-19"},{"cool":0,"text":"Love the small plates concept.

Most the food is eh. Bland, needs more something! It was reasonable for Vegas and it was clean, and the setup was nice but it is lacking something that some of the others have. There are not many specialty stations like many other buffets. I usually like to get a fresh made pasta or something and nothing stood out. The desserts were the best part of their buffet, there were some unique choices but the meats, pastas, etc were all to bland for me. The food was also all very luke warm. Nothing was hot which is sometimes a downfall of buffets but this seemed to be more than the usual.","review_id":"Aj_TsUlT10f89hXXHZkvEw","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"DK9eq2zjoESaXpXK7zZIUw","date":"2017-04-23"},{"cool":0,"text":"yum! an expensive buffet! probably in the top 10 \"on the strip\" buffets. \n\nambiance: 4 - an organized setting for food and seating. there's quite a lot of space to walk around with a mess of plates and food. \n\nservice: 4 - service was good until we reached almost the end of our dinner. the server stopped visiting our table, and I never received my tea. \n\nfood: 4 - quality food; some cooked well, some not. many dishes are aesthetically designed on separate dishes, which can sometimes be difficult to balance on your plate while grabbing other foods. \n\nthe dessert and salad sections were the most pleasing foods out of the whole selection, and they are prepared well. also, the gelato is great, but you can get it at any great buffet! \n\nbecause of WS's reputation, they should offer a really unique and tasty dessert that people will line up for!","review_id":"_Pw0Jy21KNuVpU4KgA9kjQ","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA","date":"2014-01-05"},{"cool":43,"text":"MY NEW FAVORITE LAS VEGAS BUFFET!\n\n$38 brunch includes soda, coffee and juice! Most buffets don't include soda in their prices! Service is great here! I forgot our server's name but she was on top of it! She was also very personable and friendly! LOVE HER!\n\nIt was my first time coming here on Saturday as part of my sister's bachelorette party agenda. This is her favorite place to come in Vegas so I made sure to squeeze it into the itinerary. I have been to the Bacchanal buffet at Caesars and I hated it and I have also been to The Buffet at Treasure Island which wasn't bad. Wicked Spoon exceeded my expectations!\n\nWe came around 11am for brunch and they had a selection of waffles, eggs benedict, omelets. They also have a carving station for all you meat lovers. My favorite was the saffron risotto rice with crawfish aka paella. It was so damn good!\n\nTheir Asian cuisine has drunken noddles served in cute Chinese takeout boxes. There's also an assortment of sushi.\n\nNotable mentions: Fried chicken, Angry mac and cheese\n\nTheir desserts were all so good too! Mango passionfruit mousse, red velvet bundt cake, pistachio cake, carrot cake, GELATO served in mini waffle cone bowls...\n\nMAN I'M GETTING HUNGRY! I purposefully did not STUFF myself since I was going to a pool party right after at the Aria hotel...

Don't get me wrong, the decor and the atmosphere of the seated area was lovely. It was just so pretty and nicely lit that sometimes you get fooled by how good your overall experience was just because the atmosphere was amazing... but decor aside.... the food was not up to par.\n\nLets begin...\n\nOf course i was starving after waiting 2.5 hours.. who wouldn't be?\n\nI was expecting the selection to be much bigger and grander. The dishes were nothing spectacular.. a couple of Asian dishes here and there, several sushi choices, a hot meat carving station, salad/cold cut station, and a dinky little omelet/build your own taco salad station.\n\nTo be fair, I love how they plated everything. With the individual cups/pots/baskets, that makes the experience a little more fun and definitely makes the food seem more appetizing.\n\nI was disappointed because after walking around several times, I only found several items that seemed appealing to me. Here are some of the things that were worth noting.\n\n-very fresh smoked salmon: can't really go wrong with this\n-bbq rib: actually very tender and fell off the bone\n-prime rib: perfectly cooked and just the right amount of fat\n-asparagus and green beans with garlic: veggies + garlic = win all the time\n-gelato: i had the balsamic strawberry, pistachio, and almond joy all very yummy and great in flavor\n-chocolate covered strawberries encrusted with nuts: yum to die for..the nuts were the perfect touch\n-pumpkin flavored flan: this was actually very good and not overly sweet\n\nThe not soo noteworthy... and semi disappointing\n-bone marrow: everyone raved about it.. but ours were dry and barely had any marrow\n-sauteed shrimp: you can tell that the shrimp was not fresh and overly cooked, yack\n-braised pork: it came in a little pot and was atop a layer of white beans.. very bland in flavor..\n-sushi selection: yellow tail nigiri.. omg, the slice of fish was sooo thin, what is this??\n-seared salmon: bland, no flavor, what waste to a nice piece of fish\n-pasta dishes: didn't look appealing to me, my friends said they were nothing too special\n-braise pork ribs in little to-go containers: tooo salty!!!\n-cold crab legs: i wished they were warm.. you can kinda tell they just defrost them. :(\n\nThe Service\n-actually very slow...and not that great. Took forever just to get our ice tea refilled.\n\n\nOverall?\nI would probably not return based on my experience today. I mean, their selection of desserts is on par and great... but their other food selection, or rather the lack of selection, really makes the steep price a bit hard to swallow.\n\nThere are better buffets out there.","review_id":"w7SLGtLSs4WrhiML0x7ECw","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":1,"useful":4,"user_id":"iYeLvhAGiUgKeNkZV19_IQ","date":"2012-12-26"},{"cool":0,"text":"Ë≥≠ÂüéÊòØ‰∏ÄÂÄãÊ∞∏ÈÅ†ÈÉΩ‰∏çÊúÉÂÆâÊñºÁèæÁãÄÁöÑÂüéÂ∏ÇÔºå‰∏çÊñ∑Âú∞ÂâµÊñ∞Ê±ÇËÆä‰ª•Âê∏ÂºïÊ∂àË≤ªËÄÖÂâç‰æÜÔºåÁÑ°Ë´ñÊòØÂπ´‰ªñÂÄëÊâìÈÄ†‰∏ÄÂÄãÊ∞∏Êá∑Èõ£ÂøòÁöÑÁãÇÊ≠°Â§úÊôöÔºåÊàñÊòØÊèê‰æõ‰∏ñÁïåÈ†ÇÂ∞ñÁöÑÁæéÈ£ü„ÄÅË≥ºÁâ©„ÄÅÂ®õÊ®ÇÁ≠âÂêÑÊñπÈù¢È´îÈ©óÔºåÊªøË∂≥È°ßÂÆ¢ÂêÑÊñπÈù¢ÁöÑÈúÄÊ±ÇÂ∞±ÊòØÈÄôÂÄãÂüéÂ∏ÇÊúÄÂ§ßÁöÑÈ≠ÖÂäõÔºåÂÖ®‰∏ñÁïåÁöÑË≥áÈáë‰πüÊ∫êÊ∫ê‰∏çÁµïÂú∞ÂæÄÈÄôË£°ÊπßÂÖ•ÔºåÈÄ≤Ë°å‰∏≠ÁöÑÈñãÁôºÊ°à‰∏ÄÊ≥¢Êé•Ëëó‰∏ÄÊ≥¢ÔºåÂ∞±ÂÉèÊòØÈÄôÈñìÂ§ñËßÄ‰ª•Áèæ‰ª£ÊÑüÂçÅË∂≥ÁöÑÊë©Â§©Â§ßÊ®ì‰ΩúÁÇ∫‰∏ªÈ°åÁöÑÈ†ÇÁ¥öÊóÖÈ§®Ôºå‰∏çÂÉÖÊòØË®≠Á´ãÂú®‰∏ªË°ó‰∏äÊúÄÊñ∞ÁöÑÂìÅÁâåÊóÖÈ§®‰πã‰∏ÄÔºåÂÖ∂ÂØåÊúâÁèæ‰ª£ËóùË°ìÊÑüÁöÑÊì∫Ë®≠ÔºåÂÉèÊòØÂ§ßÂª≥Áµ¢È∫óÁöÑÊ∞¥Êô∂ÁáàÈ£æÂíåÊûóÁ´ãÊóÖÈ§®ÂêÑËôïÁöÑË£ùÈ£æËóùË°ìÁ≠âÔºå‰πüÊèê‰æõÁµ¶Ê∂àË≤ªËÄÖ‰∏çÂêåËàá‰ª•ÂæÄÁöÑÊóÖÈ§®ÈÅ∏Êìá„ÄÇÁæéÈ£ü‰πüÊòØËÆìÂÖ∂ÈñãÂπïÂæåÂèóÂà∞ÂêÑÊñπÁõÆÂÖâÊ≥®ÁõÆÁöÑÂéüÂõ†ÔºåÂÉèÊòØ‰ª•

Since you're paying first, you are tipping for service that you haven't received. That was my biggest thing.\n\nA lot of people have brought up that this buffet provides a lot of choices, Asian, Italian, meat carving, salads, and a mac and cheese bar. They pre portion a lot of the food so theres less waste/people don't over grab the food they are providing. I think it has a really cute idea, but some of the portions are still too big. The quality of the food I would say was just average; I left this place with nothing to rave about.\n\nThe desert is a whole different story. Almost everything is edible! Cups of chocolate inside chocolate mousse with fresh fruit on top. They had a variety of bread pudding, gelato, and different types of pudding and baked goods.The best thing I had was the chocolate covered strawberries ( plain chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate covered strawberries with crushed oreos, and chocolate covered strawberries with toffee)\n\nFor the price ($35 for dinner) I was expecting a little more variety (sushi and salads), but it was definitely worth trying.","review_id":"0Bdyj6SZAjy3V9riJ1-cww","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"7Q6nBHl6NJ9gbJ900FkkAg","date":"2012-02-27"},{"cool":0,"text":"Food is a 3.

A food waster like me who just likes to try one bite of each thing, this made me feel less guilty not eating everything.\n\nThe lines can be quite long, however, our group of 7 only waited about 30 minutes on a Saturday night. Because it was a \"holiday weekend\", they upped the charge to $45 a person. Quite pricey, and definitley not worth it for me. No difference in food, except the cashier mentioned there was turkey.\n\nWe sat at a high table which made it a bit tougher to get in and out, but appreciated the decor and set up of this place.\n\nBuffets are a waste of $ for me, as I don't indulge in prime rib and crab legs like the majority of people. However, my girlfriends said the prime rib was one of the best they had (not just at a buffet), and enjoyed the crab legs.\n\nI sampled just about everything except for the meats. There is an Asian station with LA Kalbi, various meats with veggies, but I only wanted to try their salt and pepper calamari. Waited nearly 10 minutes for it, but it was worth it. You get about 3 pieces in a little cute frying basket. They were typical calamari, but good to have as part of the meal. The sushi here is absolutely terrible. The rice is overcooked and hard, possibly from staying out so long.\n\nThey had a variety of meats and cheeses, that I enjoyed, although I wish there was some bread or crackers to enjoy it with. Their clam chowder was really good too. My favorite of course was the pizza, which are tiny slices, perfect for me. There was a french onion, sausage and veggie, and a margherita. All very tasty. The stromboli was really good too.\n\nTheir shrimp and grits, although looks really good, the grits were way too salty for me. I was super bummed they didn't have the bone marrow everyone raved about, and was dissapointed with the mac and cheese station. Although it's really cool to have any type of protein, veggie, and cheese in your mac and cheese, it was just typical orecchietta pasta, pan cooked with pasta and meats. Very heavy, and a larger portion than I had expected.\n\nTheir dessert station was sub-par, but did enjoy the choices of having a scoop of gelato. Had 3 different kinds, and the coffee was my favorite.\n\nUnfortunately, our waitress was MIA the whole night. We got our drinks in the beginning, and over an hour later, we had to flag her down for a refill.\n\nOverall, a decent experience. Glad I tried it, but I'd definitley rather have 9 Earl Sandwiches for the price of this buffet.","review_id":"jmiZmQPAmJxEhEvPrXVn8w","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":1,"useful":5,"user_id":"iCYMf_sHRevmzWg8la-LVw","date":"2012-12-31"},{"cool":0,"text":"Unique buffet.\nCute presentation.\nWish the food had better selection & quality.","review_id":"HCnaG4Gl5uzxOlnlJ7FjSg","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"edZ6kTxithgtctw1crIkBA","date":"2014-08-20"},{"cool":1,"text":"Admittedly my experience with buffets has been limited to things like Golden Corral and various Chinese food buffets, plus one or two in Laughlin.

The assortment of food is just amazing. I recommend touring the whole lineup before creating a strategy for maximum consumption. Most of the dishes on offer come in small portions so it's easy to sample around. Meats are cut small, and most sides are in little metal bowls or little glass serving cups.\n\nHighlights on this visit were the Peking duck, five-spice pork belly, shrimp ceviche, and angry mac-n-cheese.

My favorites were the salmon, their spicy mac n cheese, shrimp, and prime rib. However, everything in general is delicious!! I like how everything is served in an individual portion so you don't have to scoop anything out. Just grab and go! The most outstanding thing is probably their desserts.

The Wicked Spoon took me into the next tier. \n\nPrices will always  be prices and at 35$ a person for brunch into dinner, you find yourself wearing off that charge with just the bone marrow. I've been to top rated places here in Southern California that run their bone marrow into the high teens and provided it with less richness than they do at the Wicked Spoon. \n\nNow for the rest of their offerings you could argue them to be from average to pretty good and I won't disagree there. You're bound to try what you're going to try so I won't hype up any individual food but rather let you know what you can expect to come across on the negative side of the field.\n\nThe Fix\n\nTheir rendition of the Mexican chicharon picadita was disrespectful to all the street vendors in Mexico. \n\nI loved the ice cream but the waffle cups had no flavor to them.\n\nTheir plate pick up and drink dispensing game was off at our table. \n\nThe omelette man was not too friendly, service overall was lacking a la Cosmopolitan style (refer to my cosmopolitan hotel review). \n\nTheir meats are alright, don't expect prime churrasqueria quality. \n\nNumber Don't Lie\n\nBuffets are some of the most reviewed businesses on Yelp for the area of Las Vegas and I have found the star ratings to be quite accurate. The Cosmopolitan's buffet at the Wicked Spoon is a a 3.5 with their bone marrow convincing me to round it up to a 4. They provide a vast array of foods and the desserts are proportioned small enough to play dessert roulette without any leftovers. Come at least once if you're wanting to get more quality than 90% of the buffets made available to you here in Vegas. For myself, I'm rubbing my hands for the next couple months when I'll be trying out the Bacchanal Buffet.","review_id":"42e2rYZHXusZdDIU3M-6Tg","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":6,"useful":12,"user_id":"pU6GoRTcl1rIOi6zMynjog","date":"2016-02-26"},{"cool":0,"text":"great presentation.","review_id":"3yLMgjGVqkSLZMPgeQo2WA","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"es15UP55rfli8OTgYr7cZA","date":"2013-01-03"},{"cool":6,"text":"Buffet inside the Cosmopolitan?  Check.  \n\nWicked Spoon is slightly different from your usual buffet.  Many of the items are actually served as if you are dining at a tapas or small plates restaurant.  Curry in tiny metal pots, fried chicken in small baskets, and pastor tacos on small square plates are just some of the items served this way.  \n\nIt's a pretty unique concept for a buffet, and it certainly helps eliminate some of the mess some of these items can create.  When's the last time you saw a clean tacos station at buffet place?  Here, it is all prepared for you and all you have to do is add the condiments.    It's also a good way to \"portion control.\"  The small plates prevents going overboard and it prevents them on making a buttload of food, except... I can only imagine how high the water bill is to wash all them plates.\n\nMostly Americanized versions of food from around the world.  Asian, French, Italian, and Mexican are some of the easy ones to spot.  Everything's fairly solid and not bad, but I do have to say the Asian selections is probably the weakest: Korean BBQ rib tasted a little off to me and the Thai curry is bland. The pastor tacos mentioned earlier is prob my favorite out of the ethnic food group.   \n\nThere's also a carving station, with prime rib and the BBQ ribs as the standout.  I'm particularly fond of the fried chicken.  It's nothing crazy but I love using the chimichurri sauce with it.  There's a meatball in marinara and goat cheese that I'm a fan of as well.\n\nThe desserts are probably my favorite.  Love the gelato here, especially the mango and lemon pomegranate.  The manga tasted like those Asian mangos and the lemon pomegranateis just tart enough.  There's also a lot of chocolate covered items such as marshmallow and strawberries.  However, I was extremely disappointed that on my 2nd visit to Wicked Spoon, they didn't have the macaroons, cause them macaroon shells were bomb.\n\nDefinitely need to try the dinner next time since both times I've been here, it was for the champagne brunch.  The champagne brunch is a good deal since the price different is only $7 from the regular brunch price.  Both times also came on a Sunday and never really had to wait that long, but still suggest to come early!","review_id":"B_qmwryaFoXNHUSqtN3pKA","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":5,"user_id":"LyrAjv8V6HWkceuTB4Xtkw","date":"2011-07-13"},{"cool":0,"text":"Long overdue for my semi-angry review...  after reading all of the amazing reviews for Wicked Spoon and seeing the 700-some odd photos that people had posted on Yelp.com, I was persuaded to skip out on the Aria Buffet for something new.  \n\nThe walk alone is a long one.  Especially if you're a girl in heels!  You will see a bunch of random artwork along the way until you hit the end of the road.  THEN, the line was a good wait & once you thought you had gotten in, they made us wait until an actual table had opened up.  \n\nThe food was good... it was my first time having ratatouille & I ended up liking it.  I thought it was interesting that the servings were on separate miniature plates/pans - but it was difficult stuffing a bunch of food on your plate as room would quickly run out.  After all of the photo clicking, I noticed how they had bone marrow, yet the afternoon I went, there was no bone marrow found.  :(  and it was one of the things I was REALLY looking forward to.  (let down, man).  I will say that the gelato was delicious and the mini desserts were so good looking and almost too pretty to eat.\n\nSince the lady at the register did not ask if I wanted to purchase the champagne brunch, it wasn't until after we had been seated and I wondered if I were to just ask for one at the table that they would bring it.  (silly me I suppose... but how was I supposed to know how the system worked if it was one of the first times I paid for a buffet, let alone it was a new one).  From the time we were seated, I had waited a good long 5 minutes until someone came to get our drink order.  I asked for a glass of champagne, the guy asked for my ID (handed it to him) - and mins later I had my drink.  After that, it was like we weren't give any attention at all.   We even had to grab our own salt and pepper from another table since the wait for someone to come by had taken so long.  No one ever came back to re-fill or take plates away.  I had to call a person to come over.  I wanted a re-fill, yet this time it was a different waiter and this guy actually took our bill, looked at it and said, that we did not purchase a champagne brunch.  I told him how we were never asked if we wanted to purchase one.  He said it would be I think it was $15 extra if I wanted it now.  (it was already towards the end of our time there anyways, so of course I said no).\n\nIt just sucked how we were treated there since the food was not bad.  The dessert area was my favorite.  Attentiveness is MUCH needed as no one seemed to pay attention & walked around like chickens with their heads cut off.","review_id":"F6k5y3SghIMqcJM0Pd5KgQ","stars":3,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"TMd_Jg0qhBL3PWqje9lnPA","date":"2011-08-17"},{"cool":1,"text":"This buffet is GOOD and I still want to show them some love but after I found a SPIDER crawling in their beloved chocolate-covered strawberries (you know, the ones everyone writes about), it completely put me off and ruined my meal.

Pretty much a sure fire way to completely lose your appetite for the rest of the day.\n\nBut I think I was more put off by the way the manager handled the situation. The server sends over the manager who just stands there as I explain (I wasn't that annoyed, I was just trying to make them aware because no one wants to eat a damn spider). But then he just stands there, doesn't really say anything and makes it really awkward. Like....was I supposed to make a bigger fuss so I can get something comped? I think it was his really quiet demeanor and just standing there that made me think \"okay so....really, you don't know how to handle it\". You could have just confidently told me you're sorry and will inform the staff about the issue. I think I was more put off by the clueless manager who didn't really know how to handle the situation.

(See also The Buffet in Wynn and Bacchanal in Caesar's Palace). Keep in mind it is a buffet and you will find much better executed food at actual restaurants. \n\nThe wait can be a bit extreme during weekends and especially during peak times of the year. When in Rome, or Vegas, I prefer to save my buffet days to a day when I feel it won't be as crowded so I haven't experienced a crowd much much but even if I had to, I'd wait here. It's worth the experience, even if you try this place at least once. \n\nThere are many great places to eat in Vegas, much better than even this buffet, so if you're not looking to gorge yourself, then maybe bust out that Yelp app. \n\nWhat makes this buffet stand out are the individual dishes here that I prefer over other buffets that may have a bit more selection. Duck confit ravioli, KBBQ ribs (though not the best), mac and cheese bar, tiny portioned out salads, fried chicken, charcuterie station, and those random little dishes that have a different twist of flavors that you won't find at other buffets make me enjoy the difference here. Many of their dishes are served in individual containers so it's interesting. \n\nI do feel there is a strong difference in quality, execution and variety of dishes you'll find here throughout the year. When I went in January, it wasn't memorable, and definitely not the place I've hyped up to some people. During Summer, it's so busy but you'll still find days in the week where the line won't be as long as the weekends and there are more food options. \n\nAs for dessert, they have better desserts elsewhere, but their Gelato is made in house and the flavors are unique. \n\nIf you're looking for many types of different cuisine and a wide assortment of dishes within that type of food or cuisine, you're better off going to Bacchanal.","review_id":"dnFSylFNYyw109k6FH9PhA","stars":4,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":2,"useful":2,"user_id":"u2RK1J_GnZtsizpzeI1fWQ","date":"2014-02-24"},{"cool":0,"text":"THE best Sunday brunch I ever had.

Though the Paris buffet is arguably just as good from what I remember, I always thought what the Bellagio had to offer was the best overall.  Well, until now that is; move over Bellagio, cuz someone has come along and snatched top billing from you.\n\nNow, don't let the trendy and chic decor distract you...there is some serious food being thrown out here.  While you will might assume it's just the generic sorts of items like salad, Chinese food, sushi, pasta/pizza, and carvery items, there is just so much more to it than that.  Rather, you can find more unique offerings like kalbi (Korean BBQ ribs...surprisingly good!), buns with pork belly, gnocchi, risotto, pork loin, beef stews, flatbreads, truffle potatoes, and even a station to build your own bowl of pho.  Seriously, how many other places can say that?  A pho station!  It'd be better if it were a ramen station, but still impressive enough!\n\nWhat's really cool about the place though is that it's not your usual sort of buffet where you pile a bunch of food on your plate and then go to town.  Rather, like the rest of the hotel, it feels so refined, with a majority of the food being served in small plates, bowls, and mini-pots.  Think like an individual tapas plate buffet.  Pretty ingenious if you ask me since it's probably better at reducing the amount of food that gets wasted or dumped.\n\nThe food alone makes the price worthwhile, but it's even more reasonable when compared to the other buffets on the strip.  Considering the quality and choices, it's not too shabby at $28 a head for lunch (by Vegas buffet standards).  Wicked Spoon has pretty much all you could ask for at a buffet, but I have to admit that the long walk back to the main part of the hotel when you've got a stomach full of food kind of sucks.  In any case, Wicked Spoon is wicked awesome (so cheesy, I know).","review_id":"0Diob97QtWfUNgHc4RLj8A","stars":5,"business_id":"K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","funny":13,"useful":19,"user_id":"JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA","date":"2011-04-14"},{"cool":1,"text":"Sweet redemption!!!\n\nMade it back here on our most recent trip, and we were so much more pleased with our experience.\n\nBrunch on Monday was $25 and included your choice of 1 mimosa, bloody mary, or glass of champagne.

Presentation wise, the food looked very good. The descriptions of the food were quite good as well. Very \"foodie\" in nature. However, where it suffered was breadth of selection and quality/execution of food, both were VERY poor.  If you can't even do a decent biscuits and gravy at a las vegas buffet, its time to give up. \n\nThere are actually TWO lines here, one where you wait to pay and a second one where you wait for a table. I don't know how much more inefficient it could have been.  Service was piss poor as well. We didn't get our drink orders in until AFTER our first plates of food were finished (and we had someone wait at the table to make sure to get it). The table next to us, jealous of our bottle of water asked us \"do we have to get our own water here?\"\n\nFoodwise, like I stated earlier, its all foodie sounding concepts that are presented in a hip fashion. Tastewise, it was very crappy and cooked on a mass-produced scale with seemingly no consideration to taste. I enjoyed maybe two selections, the french toast and the sliced lamb.  \n\nPho bar was embarrassingly bad. I'd be shocked if the stock WASN'T powdered beef stock. Smoked salmon tasted off. Chicken wings were disgusting and strange texture, Chocolate covered strawberries had a weird powder dusting which ruined the flavor. didn't even want to touch the sandwiches, pizzas or chinese food with a 10 foot pole because they just looked either dry or under the heat lamps too long.  Overly salty pastas. The list can go on and on. Also, some of the foods are hard to reach due to the low positioning of the glass shields. \n\nI've probably been to 80% of the Vegas buffets and this one rates very low on the scale.

I got a complimentary Bloody Mary with the meal (you get that or a Mimosa). \n\nThe salad bar has quite a few choices. We tried their Caesar, and a few others. All were tasty and really fresh. They had some amazing salami's, and Italian meats, as well as shrimp cocktail that is portioned out with two shrimp and sauce. \n\nThe fried chicken wings were crispy, yet juicy and perfectly seasoned. The red beans and rice were flavorful and brought back memories of Louisiana. The fish was perfectly prepared, moist yet cooked thoroughly.  The Asiago stuffed gnocchi was amazing. The macaroni and cheese was exceptional with bread crumbs on top. The only thing I wasn't too amazed with was their Chinese food, so pass on that.\n\nThe dessert bar is crazy.
