We were walking back to our hotel room when I ran into my daughter who was hanging out with her friends, and even SHE had a sandwich bag from Earl's...\n\nI guess I just don't look for sandwiches while I'm in Vegas, especially on the Strip, or in this case inside the shopping area at PH.  Another reason is that rarely frequent any sandwich chains to begin with,  although I used to go to Togo's all the time, and I briefly fell in love with Quizno's for awhile, but in these cases it was because they were one of my go to places near work...\n\nThe place seems to be popular, I'll give it that.  It's an inexpensive $6 value that you can pack to go and stands up pretty well if you want to bring it back to wherever you're staying in LV.  The toasty bread I guess is one of the best things about the sandwich, it reminds me of ciabatta bread because it's crusty and sort of sandy floury, but moistened by the oil or butter that they use to press the heated sandwich like a panini.  Efficient, they serve up the sandwiches like neatly packaged bricks in foil wrappers...\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=nbZOfLY7cUr2tnubkswwlQ\n\nAt first, I thought The Full Montagu was a play on words on The Full Monty, or maybe some Shakespearean reference -- was there also a Full Capulet sandwich (although it's really spelled \"Montague\");  no, actually it's in reference to John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich with whom the sandwich is named.  I had one, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=3rHsnjWiJQIDCWMWE-mT1git was a two meat, two cheese sandwich consisting of roast beef, turkey, aged swiss, and cheddar, with lettuce, tomato, and mustard.  It was a very hardy sandwich and admittedly very satisfying.\n\nWe also had The Italian http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=IjSHtwUtQzJjGi2-6pBaWA and wifey had a more subdued Caprese. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=EXD7ciCNLGuEZNuPXdNYJA  They seemed to be satisfied with their choices...\n\nOpen 24 hours, I heard that this place is popular among the clubbing crowd as a late night snack.  To me this is still just a freakin sandwich place that isn't even a deli which I generally favor, but I would have to admit that it has a pretty successful following, and that being open at all hours for $6 is a pretty good value...","review_id":"vdTjSph1v0SACwrtZh3nug","stars":4,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":4,"useful":6,"user_id":"LP59kBNEHmASJZWynra29g","date":"2011-10-30"},{"cool":30,"text":"A 24 hour cheap hot sandwich place is a vegas jackpot!!!

Most people might say that the best part of a sandwich is the meat or the sauce, but I believe that it was the \"Earl's artisan bread\" that did it for me.

Perfect match.   \n\nHubby and I both decided to order the same sandwich, pastrami, which doesn't let me write an extensive review of the food.  It was a good sandwich, very lean pastrami, but not all that plentiful.  The reported swiss cheese wasn't noticeable.  That was okay with me: I don't like swiss cheese, but didn't change it because to my way of thinking, cheese on a pastrami sandwich is sacrilegious.\n\nStrip prices being what they are, though, I guess it was as much as we should have expected, because this was  reasonably priced based on Earl's location.  The bread?  Good, now that I've all but given up hope of ever finding a sandwich on a crisp baguette in Las Vegas.  I'll have to go back to the east coast for that bit of heaven.\n\nWe also ordered a bowl of tortilla soup.  I didn't want to, since I learned only after asking that it's a cream soup.  Rule #1:  authentic tortilla soup does not contain cream.  Rule #2:  I should not eat creamed soups.  They're bad for me.  And for my husband.  But he's not as much as a stickler for the rules as I am, so I let him get it after learning - again only after asking - that the tomato soup was also CREAM of tomato.

At no time, sober or un-sober, was I really in any way impressed by these sandwiches. This is sort of an up-jumped Quiznos with the added bonus that the bread starts out unbaked and bakes as it's going through the conveyor belt. However the ingredients going in to the sandwich seem fairly standard for fast food quality, maybe slightly better, and the flavor coming out the other end simply wasn't there for me. Yeah they're greasy gut bombs and people like that, but coming from the land of Bunk Sandwiches (greasy gut bombs that they be), this is nowhere near what I'd consider to be gourmet or even all that great. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I'd take this any day over a McDonald's burger or similar. And compared to the vast array of gross casual food served on the strip, this is a step above.

Secondly, they were very liberal with the kalamata olives and the roasted red peppers - usually I find that budget friendly places skimp on those kinds of ingredients. \n\nMy friend ordered the Turkey Club Sandwich and creamy tomato soup.  The bread on the sandwich was really, really good! It was thick and hearty with lots of flavor, and slightly toasted - loads better than anything you could find at Quizno's or Slobway.....  The tomato soup was delicious. I was hesitant to try it because they add croutons to it before serving, so I thought it would be a soggy mess....I was wrong!

Hope everyone had a terrific NY celebration (nothing crazy and unsafe, yet extremely awesome and entertaining!)  Now the New Year is upon us, let me start off with a 5 star review for ya'll!\n\nEarl of Sandwich... I've never really been a sandwich fanatic and this was all the rage prior to my recent last trip to Vegas by everyone I know and all the reviews posted on yelp.  On the day we were going to be leavin' LV I've decided to give it a shot by walking across the street for a quick brunch at Earl's.\n\nOh boy am I glad that I did just that!\n\nYou know... sandwiches are sandwiches.. nothing spectacular but nothing too horrible either... (a very safe type of food).  However, here at Earl's it's absolutely incredible on how they can possibly make things tastes so good!\n\nAgain due to my typical curiosity and the irresistible temptation on trying new things,  I've decided to almost but the entire menu for my food tasting lab I've set up in Bellagio.  (I end up getting the Full Montagu, Hawaiian BBQ, Caribbean Jerk Chicken, and the Earl Cobb Salad.)  The sandwiches were $5.99 each with a decent portion (ain't the size of subway but quality is much much better!), and with two drinks the total came out to like $31 and change...(slightly pricey in my mind but gotta give it a try)\n\nI did share all this food with 3 other people though,,, so I not really the pig that I say I am.....\n\nSo here were our thoughts...\n\nFull Montagu:  Great roast beef sandwich with turkey and swiss cheese... the roast beef was the real deal and it had the texture of soft arby's roast beef..... So taking that soft morsels that you call beef coupled with high quality you get an awesome sandwich!\n\nHawaiian BBQ:  I didn't get to try this as my friend devoured it down in a quick few minutes... so I'm gonna take that gesture as awesome and leave it as that!  \n\nJamaican Jerk Chicken:  Jerk flavored chicken + roasted bell peppers in a jerk sauce made this sandwich really really delicious!  That's all I can tell you!  Yum!\n\nHighlights of these sandwiches, the BREAD!  They toasted in a way where it's just the right moisture, the right texture, the right flavor, the right crispiness, and the right size overall!  It's just a really delicious bread to compliment all the dressings in between!  I've always believed that what makes a sandwich great is simply the bread itself, and Earl of Sandwich really proved that to be the main point!\n\nEarl Cobb:  Aside from having slightly too much dressing that I would have liked (I always watch my dressing calorie count as this is the main trick in getting a salad), it was absolutely delicious!  I've have had many salads in various places, I gotta say that this is one of the more tasty salads for a fast food joint.  Definitely worth the price!  (The people I was with weren't even into salads and they really enjoyed that too!)\n\nIt's sort of weird that if you want ice tea you have to ask for it.... but you got the typical fountain drinks available for you (pepsi products)\n\nOne final note.... this place has recently updated their operational hours and it is now 24 hrs!!!  WOW!  That's so awesome!  So you're telling me when I'm hungry late at night working on them slots, I can get myself a sandwich to go, sit down at the slot, blackjack machine, or anywhere to be gambling and eating at the same time?  I Love Vegas!!!\n\nSo there you have it folks!  The first review of 2011 by yours truly and it is definitely a 5 stars in my mind.  So again hope everyone will be having a SUPER DUPER 2011 and if you do visit Vegas, may the money gods follow you to every machine/table you go to, and the sandwich gods guide you to Earl of Sandwich!","review_id":"2cWPdxqomzrhmg8-JbSWxA","stars":5,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":10,"useful":12,"user_id":"sys6XtOZVLDzwn3qistBKw","date":"2011-01-01"},{"cool":0,"text":"This place serves the best quick service sandwiches.

And for a limited time, they're doing a chicken pesto sammy, that's not too bad either.  It stood out a little less for me, since it didn't have the sweetness of the Hawaiian nor the spiciness of the Caribbean.

It is only fitting that a sandwich the menu be named after the Montagu legacy.

Several of tables were dirty. An employee on break was clearly not happy that we were sitting near her in the quieter section and not amongst the bright, teetering post-club groups around the corner. The seat cushions were ripped. Bleh.\n\nOh, and I'd ordered the Wisconsin Cheese soup without thinking to ask if it was vegetarian (my fault - I should know better with soups), so I was grumpy to open the lid and see all of the little clumps of bacon. (And grumpy because, again, this was my fault, so I didn't feel like I could take it back.) I tried to get my husband to eat it, but he pushed it away after a bite and a half. \"It tastes like Velveeta with bacon bits.\" (Now that's the restaurant's fault.)\n\nI found myself wishing that we'd gone to Krung Thai or Peppermill, where their Caprese sandwich leaves me nuzzling my hands for an hour afterward. Mmmmm.

This bread is really chewy and delicious, and it's nice to have a hot Caprese. It's also nice that they have more than one vegetarian sandwich. Maybe a three-and-a-half.\"\n\nThe next day I found myself wishing for another hot Caprese. Okay, four stars it is. I had to remember to compare this with Subway and Quiznos, not with other late-night options. Four stars for a menu with two hot vegetarian sandwiches on distinctive bread, for pagers that mean you can find a place to sit and relax and wait for your order to be ready, for friendly staff (at least those on-duty), and for being open 24 hours.\n\nMinus a star for dirty tables, for lazy frozen lemonade, for soup that tastes like processed cheese, for a cake-like chocolate-chip cookie of minimal flavour that would be overpriced at half the price, and for charging $6 for a 6\" meatless sandwich that, once you get past the bread, is nothing special.\n\nI'm still craving a sandwich on nice bread, though... which is why it's going to be Schlotzsky's for lunch tomorrow.

That's for food, gas, hotel, everything.\n\nOne of the reasons I was able to do this was that I got two meals out of Earl of Sandwich for a grand total of $6.48.  My car got to Vegas hours before our friends, so we decided to have a cheap, casual dinner.  I did a quick search on Yelp, and this place came up with its hundreds of reviews.\n\nEarl of Sandwich is in Planet Hollywood, a kind of funny theme hotel if you know anything about Los Angeles.  I find it amusing that the mall is billed as the Miracle Mile Shops, as if the Miracle Mile is a glamorous shopping mecca in L.A.  Even Earl of Sandwich is out of place - it's a chain restaurant, but there isn't a single branch in California.\n\nDon't be alarmed that it's a chain.  It's a step up from Quizno's (though I like Quizno's, and Subway, too), and I appreciated its impressive efficiency.  There was a short line to order, but once we got our orders in, we sat down with our buzzers.  They started buzzing while we were getting water, and our food was hot and ready within five minutes of arrival.\n\nI ordered the Full Montagu with roast beef, turkey, aged swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce.  I had half for dinner and half for lunch the next day - I never went hungry, and the sandwich reheated great.  It was really tasty, with good ingredients and plenty of them.  I also tried some of my friends' orders - the Italian sandwich and the Earl's Cobb.  The Italian was maybe even better than the Montagu, with a meatfest of salami, capicola, ham, and mortadello, topped with mozzarella, roma tomato, and a zesty Italian dressing.  Peppers were optional and delicious.  Even the salad was pretty good.  It wasn't a deprivation salad - it came with plenty of grilled chicken and bacon, swiss and cheddar cheese, and a buttermilk ranch dressing.  But it also had plenty of greens and tomato, cucumber, and cranberries.\n\nIf you're in Vegas for the full Vegas experience, go balls out, hit Robuchon, whatever you want.

It's crazy how a sandwich consisting of only roast beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce practically changed my life.

I was surprised because it was almost like they had cut it with a knife, thick enough that you could tell the meat was rare.

We first had Earl of Sandwich in Florida and instantly fell in love with the reasonable prices and solid food.\n\nUnlike other places which toasted fully cooked bread, Earl of Sandwich's ciabatta bread comes probably 98% baked and leaves the remaining 2% for their toasting oven. That allows their bread to develop a lovely golden brown crispy crust on the outside while retaining a dense chewy texture on their inside. The robust little loaves really hold up to the fillings and sauces.\n\nThe ratio of bread to filling is perfect - not too much to overwhelm the bread but substantial enough to feel satisfied. The lettuce is green leaf cut in whole pieces which adds a nice textural contrast while the tomatoes are perfectly ripe. The meats are well-prepared and succulent, unlike the typical rubbery flavourless textures you might see at your regular fast food outlets. They usually add just the right amount of sauce to moisten the filling without making everything soggy.\n\nGiven the great prices and quality, this place can get pretty busy throughout the day unless you get here early in the morning.

Great variety of gourmet muffins, cookies (jumbo sized or cookie bites), brownies or for the healthier option fruit parfaits. \n\n* Chipotle Chicken Avocado - Favorite! Grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce. This sandwich is very straightforward, but the combination of flavors are awesome! This is my favorite sandwich on the menu. The chicken is moist, avocado is buttery, the chipotle flavor is mild, but it all works very well together! Rated: 5/5\n\n* Caprese - Simple, yet packed with flavor and freshness! It's your classic caprese on a toasted sandwich. They add a fair amount of thick juicy slices of mozzarella and basil. They also top it with a dreamy balsamic glaze. It's definitely a love at first bite situation. This sandwich also paired very well with the creamy tomato soup. Rated: 4/5\n\n* The Original 1762 - The bare basic. Moist roasted beef, melted cheddar, and some horseradish sauce. The roast beef was tender and flavorful. I didn't detect much cheddar and the horseradish sauce flavor was very mild. It's easy on the stomach, especially if you knocked one too many down and need some help sobering up. Rated: 3/5\n\n* Hawaiian BBQ - Not my favorite. A large piece of chicken breast, BBQ sauce and 2 slices of canned pineapple rings. The construction of the sandwich made it messy; the insides slid around and made it awkward when I bit the sandwich. The sandwich was overwhelmed by BBQ sauce and canned pineapple flavor, nothing exciting. Great concept, but poorly executed and not memorable. Rated: 1/5\n\n* Holiday Turkey - Turkey, stuffing, turkey gravy, cranberry sauce & mayonnaise. The overall flavor fell flat. I didn't taste the holiday flavors that were advertised. Nothing really stood out, so it all just became a bland mush. Rated: 3/5\n\n* Tomato soup - Yum! Very creamy and comforting. It has a bold tomato cream flavor and I really love the freshly fried croutons, they added amazing texture and flavor to the soup. It's my favorite soup here and always pairs well with all of the sandwiches. Rated: 5/5\n\n* Broccoli Cheddar - Tastes just like Subway's version. Not too creamy or flavorful, more on the bland and watery side. Rated: 3/5\n\n* Brownie - $2.29 A classic brownie that's moist, fluffy and tasty. I took two bites and saved the rest for later.

The line was really long when we arrived and the seating appeared to be full.  I hate standing in line, but that is a good sign that they are doing something right.  Surprisingly, the line moved quickly.  The Earl is known for their hot sandwiches, we ordered two:  The Original 1762 is one of their signature hot sandwiches with roast beef, sharp cheddar, and creamy horseradish sauce on an artisan baked loaf.  I enjoyed the horseradish mayo.  The French Dip is only being served for a limited time.  It has roasted beef , sauteed red onions, on an artisan baked loaf and comes with Au Jus on the side.  I think they should have given a little more Au Jus.  We added a bowl of creamy tomato soup served with burnt croutons.  Cups of ice water are free.  Their bread is pretty good, but they are a bit stingy with the meat.  They slice the sandwich in half and the meat is clumped in the center giving the appearance that it has lots of meat.  Feels a little like false advertising.  The whole bill came in around $18.  By the time we got our food there was plenty of seating.  Apparently people move through pretty quickly.  The Earl is basically fast food like Quiznos or Panera Bread.  This place has a ton of reviews because it is one of the few places on the strip for tourists to get descent food at a low price.  I would eat there again if in the area, but it is not worth the hassle of the strip just for a sandwich.  Hey locals, there are far better options off the strip.

Its a major value in an expensive city( on the strip) too.  12.00 for a sandwich, soup and chips.

Overall, its pretty good and I know I will want to come back every so often. \n\nFirst of all, the prices are very reasonable. All of their sandwiches, salads and wraps are priced at either $5.99 or $6.49. Don't be intimidated if you see a long line. The second time I came here, the line was so long that I thought for sure it would take me at least 30 minutes to get to the register and order. But that wasn't the case because the employees did a good job at keeping the line moving. \n\nThe food didn't quite blow me away, but it was still pretty good. Definitely better than Subway, Quiznos, etc. I have tried the Earl's Club and the Full Montagu. I felt that they were stingy with the turkey in the Club. I had maybe 2 thin slices in my sandwich. Unfortunately, you don't have a choice for your bread. It would be nice to have other options like wheat or cheese. But, the white bread was good enough - fresh and crispy on the outside. The chocolate chip cookie and brownie cream sandwich were tasty as well. Apparently the brownies here are made from Ghirardelli Chocolate! \n\nI usually take my order to go since all the tables are always occupied.

Many people mentioned that their sandwiches are huge and big enough to share...I disagree though (but perhaps I'm spoiled by the ginormous sandwiches in the Bay Area).\n\nAnyway, I shared the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich and a cup of Clam Chowder with my boyfriend and I thought that was the perfect amount of food.  The sandwich was grilled to a perfect crisp and the chicken was very moist.  The sauce added the right amount of tang and kick and the banana peppers added the perfect extra crunch.  I would definitely recommend that sandwich.  The clam chowder on the other hand was very mediocre and not something that I would get again.\n\nWe had a 10% (or 15%?) off coupon from the Miracle Mile Coupon Book (available at the information desk...just present your key card if you are staying at PH or mention the Southwest Spirit Magazine) so our total came out to be a little under $9, which is an awesome deal for lunch for two in Vegas ;)\n\nBest of all, Earl of Sandwich is open 24/7 so you can grab an awesome cheap meal any time of the day!","review_id":"Pl9qwNHxBM1RlHeJoGy7RA","stars":4,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"2ttZShfOh7m_5e_jSrtQQw","date":"2010-08-07"},{"cool":0,"text":"I was quite excited about trying Earl of Sandwich for the first time but I was disappointed.

I've been here countless times, and tried just about the entire menu including the to-go desserts and drinks. On this last Vegas trip, I was willing to tip the valet several bucks to leave the car out by the curb, just so I could run inside the casino and buy $30 worth of sandwiches. \n\nEveryone knows their bread is one of the keys to their success. Lightly toasted on the outside, yet incredibly soft and fluffy on the inside. The quality of the ingredients on the inside is top notch. Then there's the packaging -- it looks like hot, gold brick, and it feels solid in your hands. As the cliche goes, it's worth it's wait in gold.\n\nA few other tidbits -- I'm a fan of the bacon that they use in their sandwiches. If you love bacon, just find a sandwich with bacon. It's crispy and has just enough saltiness to balance everything out. Don't forget about the meatball sandwich, aka the \"Cannonball.\" The meatball is juicy, and the bread soaks up all the flavors.\n\nIf you're pressed for time in the morning, don't forget about their breakfast sandwiches. They put any other breakfast sandwich to shame. Parched after walking a block on the Strip in 110 degree weather, but don't want to spend a ton on those overpriced, alcoholic slushy drinks in phallic containers? Try the frozen lemonade here. It's refreshing, it's $3, and will send you into a spinning brain freeze in no time.","review_id":"YtrKQgf2H3ZmPJ2-rO-UqA","stars":5,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":5,"useful":10,"user_id":"KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g","date":"2011-08-10"},{"cool":10,"text":"Maybe it's bc I'm an east coast sammie lover or I wasn't toasted when I ate here, but this place is average as can be for me.

Thankfully the wait for my actual food was pretty short, I had just grabbed some napkins and filled my drink. \n\nMy sandwich was good but mindblowing? No. Not even close. The bacon was well cooked, nothing ruins a BLT quicker then soggy bacon.. but I have had more flavorful bacon elsewhere. The bread was tasty but greasy, causing me to require a ton of napkins.

Thank goodness the group decides to walk around them to order.\n\nWhat pissed me off was we tried telling management about it, it's not fair to all the other people waiting in line. The response they gave: they merely shrugged their shoulders and said \"okay\". #WTF. They could've at least put line cutters on last or something. They didn't even seem to care that it was bothering other customers.\n\nNot to mention their service is terribly slow. We watched the only sandwich cutter take his sweet time cutting the sandwiches as other sandwiches piled up in the oven (since it's on a conveyor belt). It ended up being burnt. -_-\n\nIf it wasn't for the fact that this was the closet place to cheap eats near Vdara, probably wouldn't come here again.","review_id":"YnToeEzqO1oVlBCPBiOTEQ","stars":2,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":1,"useful":3,"user_id":"6nvUppVogRTTwZCgaYCPjw","date":"2014-09-09"},{"cool":0,"text":"located in planet hollywood, this lunch time hot sandwhich was super delish carribean jerk chicken, peppers, cheese an chicken and a special mayo sauce, just enought to fill you up. i only had the sandwhich and a drink about $12 i would consider this a cheap eat.they have salads and wraps as well. there are very few EOS sandwhcihs thru out the US. luckily ill havr one in my area soon downtown disney..they have sweets like brwnie bites/cookies unfortunetly too stuffed to try those, next trip maybe","review_id":"cr0XtJrENDk8p3RvnscD5Q","stars":4,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"GUnoE4eMWwnB2B777S-Jdg","date":"2012-04-29"},{"cool":5,"text":"This sandwich shop is a blessing!

They're made-to-order, so they're toasty and warm. Plus, the bread is out of this world and the sandwich is a great fix at basically any time of the day. The lines move pretty fast, also. \n\nI opted to get the Original (which is basically what I get every time), and it doesn't disappoint. Use the horseradish/grey poupon sauce on the table for a little kick. \n\nThanks for a fast, delicious, and cheap option... and for being open when everything else isn't!","review_id":"GNX3x4-It7stWB-H5pFNdw","stars":5,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":0,"useful":3,"user_id":"TfaNjaJFkK9Dz9zPfKm8YQ","date":"2014-02-20"},{"cool":0,"text":"bonus... located right across from Sugars.  :D\n\nwe came per suggestion of Michelle E.  and actually went with her on her second trip..

The staff will take your sandwich order at the first counter and provide a pager to indicate when your food is ready.  We arrived at 1030am and the line was already building with the lunch crowd.

It's too bad that it's located within the strip. Sure, it can be a great spot for tourists, but a terrible place for a local to hit up. The strip is never a fun place to travel to, especially during the peak dining hours. Despite that, I guess I shouldn't complain though. The next closest location is over 1,000 miles away.\n\nI've been here a few times. Never been disappointed once. Here's a brief rundown on two things I tried:\n\n\"The Full Motagu - Roasted Beef, Turkey, Swiss & Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Earl's Mustard.\" It's a more traditional tasting sandwich, but really hits the sweet spot if this is what you're in the mood for.\n\n\"All American - Roasted Turkey, Buttermilk Ranch, Cranberries, Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce & Tomato.\" This was one of my favorites. The addition of cranberries added a nice twist to the sandwich. It's somewhat comparable to the Bobbie at Capriotti's, except you don't feel like you went through a Thanksgiving feast after eating it.\n\nPrices are definitely very reasonable for a strip location. I'd think that these prices were for an off-strip location. A hot sandwich will run you about $6-8. Add a cup of tomato soup with your sandwich and you're golden. This isn't a place I'd go out of my way for, but a sure stop every time I'm in the area.","review_id":"mEGcuz98Z9kItFNRRD6Vsg","stars":4,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA","date":"2010-04-06"},{"cool":0,"text":"Sigh.

The bread here is baked fresh to order and is fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside- yum.  The All American sandwich was okay, but again the quality of the turkey was off putting.  It had cranberry sauce, buttermilk ranch, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheddar.  The fellow reviewer who said this sandwich trumps the Bobbie must have had a few too many, I mean really.  The tuna melt, however, was great- very simple with just tuna salad and melted cheese, but delicious.  If you like tuna melts then this is the place for you (that might have been a 5-star sandwich!).  Potato salad was average and they have a selection of other salads and kettle chips.  There is also an assortment of baked goods, unfortunately the chocolate cupcake we tried was yellow cake mix with chocolate frosting (lame!).  The earl gray lemonade was refreshing and delicious, and I loved that it was something different.  Major props for having good vegetarian options (veggie sandwich with feta and peppers and a caprese).  I'd probably come back for the tuna melt and an earl gray lemonade, but I am shocked that this place has better ratings than the much superior Tom Colicchio brainchild Witchcraft (which uses vastly superior ingredients and has more exciting offerings).

I had to order another sandwich just so I can have that satisfied full feeling. So 12 bucks for a foot long? Sheesh! They only use one kind of bread which is a ciabatta type. It's good but if they had sourdough or wheat it can give whatever choice sandwich you choose a whole nother world of flavor. For their meat whether it's chicken, ham, roast beef, or turkey, they put just enough for you to be able to taste it. Of course you can double the meat for an additional charge. Also don't forget you need a drink to wash it down. So more money out of your wallet. Just do what some people do. They ask for a water cup and fill it with soda. Won't be long before they start charging for that too probably. If you eat here at any time between 12 and 4 am, you're guaranteed to see drunk, fresh from the club, and high people gettin their hungry grub on. I don't know about you guys, but nothing good ever happens between those hours and Earl's is no exception.\n\nSo for the positives. Yes their sandwiches are flavorful, open 24 hours, (which is not always a good thing as described above), and at least you get free refiils on soda. \n\nSo if I just happen to be at Planet Hollywood for some reason and it's not the freaks come out at night period, I will have a sandwich or two if my wallet allows it.","review_id":"ihF447flRd0txdjOxhB7IQ","stars":2,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":3,"useful":4,"user_id":"0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg","date":"2012-06-09"},{"cool":1,"text":"I don't do sandwiches.

Not a Nevada only chain like some others were lead to believe, but a national one.

It's a classic choice, perhaps their most popular one, and it is delicious any time - whether its hungry and sober or hungover and blacked out. A fun combination is the Turkey Holiday (aka the Thanksgiving dinner), which features turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and gravy. There are a multitude of sandwiches that fit every palate, every craving, and thankfully are between $5-8 each.

Luckily it wasn't too crazy and the line moved pretty quickly. The wife and I decided to order 3 sandwiches to share. All 3 were really great sandwiches...the bread is amazing and I thought they portioned everything just right. It's not hard to eat a sandwich and a half but for food on the strip, the pricing is on point. \n\nThe Full Montagu - I believe this is one of their staple sandwiches and that's for good reason. The turkey and roast beef are both tender and on their own, have great flavor. This sandwich came out with the perfect temp and both cheeses (aged swiss/sharp cheddar) were melted perfectly. They also add a killer mustard sauce which just made it even better.\n\nChipotle Chicken Avocado - My wife's favorite of the 3. Large chunks of juicy chicken, a good amount of bacon and compared to most other sandwich joints, huge pieces of avocado. The chipotle sauce had great flavor and didn't overpower the sandwich which I really liked.\n\nThe Italian - This was our least favorite of the 3 but still a good sandwich. The flavor was great but they put way too much Italian dressing on it. My favorite part was the cheese, I am a cheese lover and they put huge slices of fresh mozzarella on here...amazing!\n\nThe bread was exactly the same on all 3 and it's definitely up their in the top for sandwich joints. It tastes fresh baked and it has perfect texture. It's a bit like ciabatta but without the crisp outside. Chewy all the way through, taste good and super soft. Just excellent bread!\n\nWe also had some sides...potato salad and a fruit cup. The potato salad was ok and the fruit was fresh but neither stood out except for the prices. They give you very small prepackaged cups of the sides and they cost $2.49 each. I wish I had tried the mac n cheese that everyone seems to rave about.\n\nWas this the best sandwich I ever ate? No...but they were definitely on the top and deserve every bit of the thousands of positive reviews they get. They do have quite a small seating area and I'm usually not big on going down to the strip just to eat, but I wouldn't hesitate going back for more. In my opinion, PH has some of the best spots for food on the strip and Earl's is one of them.","review_id":"ry1ky8AXRHZillBNiS2WRg","stars":4,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ","date":"2013-09-03"},{"cool":0,"text":"Pretty good for sandwiches I'd say.

The bread was nicely toasted, but it was still soft and buttery in the inside. I thought that the profile of the sandwich was very well balanced on flavors.  Well balanced as in having a refreshing taste from the cucumber, a smoky flavor from the roasted peppers, and a salty and tart component from the feta cheese. Very well balance on my palate. I was very pleased, especially that it was under $7.00 in LAS VEGAS and on The Strip, inside Planet Hollywood.\n\nIt got really packed when I was here and it seemed like a few guests were having a difficult time looking for a place to sit and dine.

It is a good white bun, a delectable cross between a biscuit and ciabatta, but I am a girl who enjoys at least the option of wheat.\n\n2. Do they have hot peppers? No. I think the hallmark of a noble sandwich shop is their ability to heat up a sammie with peppers. The spiciest thing the Earl offers is pepperoncini. That does not count. It might as well be a pickle.\n\n3. Where's the beef? The meat inside the slices was a little skimpy. The ratio of bread to meat was approximately 3 to 1. \n\n4. Am I full? After one sandwich, I am pretty sure I could have eaten another without suffering from a stomach ache. \n\nYes, the end product tastes darn good. They are open 24-hours.

I had heard good things about it from friends, and had read lots of great Yelp reviews, so I was exciting to give it a try this past weekend when visiting Las Vegas.  \n\nMy initial impression of the food was not good.  I was let down by the fact that my bread was pretty badly burnt on one side.  I had taken my food to go, and did not make the discovery of my bread being burnt until I got back to my room.  However, even with the sandwich being burnt, it was still decent.  Besides being burnt, the flavor of the other ingredients really stood out.  I had ordered the 'The Original', which is a roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce.  After feeling like I missed out on something good, I decided to go back to the Earl of Sandwich the next day to give it another shot.  I ordered the same sandwich again, and it was so much better with the bread being slightly toasted.  I also got a potato salad, and liked that as well.  Overall, it was a very tasty meal.\n\nIt is so hard to judge a place based off of one experience, and I am so glad that I went back to give the Earl of Sandwich another try.

So after this past Vegas trip for spring break with the girls we ended up staying at Planet Hollywood for a week.\n\nLet me just say that for a week of staying here, me and my girlfriend ate here 5x in a row and made sure to buy 3 sandwiches before we headed back home to Hawaii. I've only tried the tuna melt because everything else sounded delicious but it contained meat in them (I'm a pescinarian). For about $7.00 a sandwich which is a huge and incredibly delicious sandwich it'll leave you tummy full, your mouth happy and you wanting and craving for more. \n\nI like that the workers are very fast in making the sandwiches, they line does look long but it moves pretty fast. They do have a small dining area but we only did takeout so we could bring it back upstairs to our room. I like the fact that they only use one type of bread which is good so it doesn't leave you with thoughts of \"what bread should I get\" \"Will this bread be good\". It's perfectly toasted to perfection and the tuna and Swiss cheese just blends so well in the sandwich...*so simple but good*. \n\nFriends tried the breakfast sandwich and he said it was yummy and another friend tried the American and she said it was perfect! But she still liked the tuna melt the best.

So my 5 star rating shouldn't be misconstrued as me saying I would frequent them all the time, but rather based on convenience and price compared to what you typically find in a Las Vegas casino. At $6 you would be hard pressed to find a better sandwich on the Vegas strip. Is it the best sandwich I have ever had? Certainly not. However, with warm bread, tasty meat and relatively quick service... you can't beat Earl of Sandwich. Added bonus is that it is directly across from the Sports Book... grab a sandwich and go sit and watch a game. \nI agree with Misti that they have a major lack of options for not only bread but toppings and sauces. No oil and vinegar? How does a sandwich shop not have oil and vinegar?\nSandwich is not overly filling, which could be either good or bad depending on how you look at it. Heading to see Peepshow? Probably don't want to sit through that on an overstuffed stomach! Grab some Earl and you will be good to go!\nI order the Full Montague (I believe) which has turkey and roast beef.

My fat Hawaiian friend recommended this spot and after building his creditability with the Pizzeria @ The Cosmopolitan, I gave in.  Earl's is pretty easy to find and is right across from the Sugar Factory.  The sandwich shop was pretty busy, but it could of been the holiday, 4th of July.\n\nThe menu is extensive and consists of hot sandwiches, salads & wraps, desserts, breakfast items, and beverages and smoothies.  I opted for a hot sandwich, more specifically the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  The sandwich is subtle and includes grilled chicken, roasted red & banana peppers, and their signature spicy jerk sauce.\n\nThe sandwich was mouth watering delicious.  The chicken was nicely grilled and seasoned.  The lettuce, tomato, and peppers gave it that crunch, and their jerk sauce gave it that kick without overwhelming the overall taste. The food was awesome, but I do suggest ordering a large or two sandwiches, as I was left somewhat unfilled after my regular sized sandwich.

My friends are going to hate me for this, but I just have to say it. Earl of Sandwich is good, but it is definitely not amazing or 5 star worthy. I'm SORRY!!\n\nSince it opened, I've probably been here numerous times. And i must say, it's pretty much a staple in all of my Vegas visits. Why then, do I only give it 3 stars? Well.. personally I think the sandwiches are good here but it's not the best sandwich i've ever had in my life... \n\nFor a meal at the wee hours of the night, a nice pipping hot, cheesy, melty, carb heavy, meaty sandwich is probably the only thing that will make your night of debauchery even better.\n\nWith that said, yes, if you haven't tried Earls, you must do so. You just must.. for the experience, for the claim that you've tried it, and for your own judgment. You must wait the in the atrocious line (which really isn't that bad) and judge for yourself if this place is up to the hype.\n\nThe sandwiches are good a size, they don't skimp on the meat, and the ingredients are simple and straight to the point. Also for around $6, it's one of the better deals on the strip that won't go breaking your bank.\n\nAnyhow, if you must try it.. go for the Full Montagu. For a first timer, that is the best choice. But do be warned, their sandwiches are greasy! So be prepared...and the bread is pretty thick, so half the sandwich will probably fill you up.\n\nNonetheless, personally, I only come here because my friends are in LOVE with Earls and will not stand a trip without a visit. So, for the culture, for the fun, and for the love of late night drunken grub, here's 3 stars.","review_id":"OQaOJzg9hE01vKMIQGQJ2w","stars":3,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":1,"useful":2,"user_id":"iYeLvhAGiUgKeNkZV19_IQ","date":"2012-12-26"},{"cool":1,"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!

Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  It is just toasted perfectly.  \n\nAs for the Caprese, it's your classic mozzarella, tomato, and basil with a balsamic vinaigrette.  I wish there was more basil cause I think we only saw two leaves of basil.  Two!  Sorta ridiculous for a whole sandwich but the thick sliced mozza was a nice touch.\n\nThere's also some pastries and cookies available.  I went for the chocolate chip cookie.

Who the eff wakes up before 11 in vegas, unless you just stay up all night, it is earl's so it might just be worth it.","review_id":"6x9kFYSQbYS3nMPVARQ-nQ","stars":5,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"Jb2F3GuqF8Doa0TK7yXnGw","date":"2011-04-06"},{"cool":0,"text":"Earl of Sandwich is a touristy place with average tasting sandwiches. I ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich without the bacon. The sandwich was poorly made and all of the ingredients in it were sub par. Romaine lettuce wilted and the cheddar cheese tasted like plastic. Bread was fine but the grill or panini maker they make it on needs to be cleaned more thoroughly because it had that dirty type of grill taste. Not impressed and this is why I rarely eat in casinos.","review_id":"-c36ZFdFirOh5u6fIHqaRw","stars":2,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"hulIBBzPsCaQDcoh_JgSBA","date":"2014-06-16"},{"cool":2,"text":"Looking for a quick cheap bite of food right on the strip? Well look no further than the Earl of Sandwich at PH - it is worthy of the title Earl of Sandwich for a reason. \n\nThe location is in the rear of PH near the mall area and generally has a steady line throughout most of the lunch and evening dinner rush. \n\nMy first visit I had the BLT and was pleasantly surprised by flavors of just those basic fresh ingredients. The bacon was generously diced up and tied together on their signature bun so well we came back the next day. I then tried there Holliday sandwich at the recommendation of my friends, though it is not the same as Capriotti's I was slightly nervous ordering it here. IT IS SIMPLY AMAZING. The simple flavors of thinly cut turkey, cranberry, and stuffing come together so well on this sandwich I  wish there were more locations throughout the U.S. The house brand chips pair very well with any sandwich you order - my personal favorite was the sea salt and vinegar.\n\nThere is a selection of teas, soda's, and beer offered at this location with prices on par with other locations in the area.\n\n5 stars - you have to check this out, it's worth your time.","review_id":"Wox0j-tUhpOghjoGDPXWOw","stars":5,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"beW2I8sRZr1CDC5szfjW8A","date":"2013-10-14"},{"cool":1,"text":"Best Sandwiches I've had in my life!!!! My friend and I came here after a crazy weekend. We heard about how good this place was from other people. As soon as we got there we knew it must be good cause there was a loooong line!! About 30min later we ordered what we wanted. I ordered the Tuna Melt and the Caribbean Jerk Chicken. My friend got the Meatball one and the Tuna Melt. After waiting anxiously for our sandwiches, our order was finally ready. I took my first bite into the Tuna Melt and it was so freaking good I almost cried. Crunchy warm toasted bread, soft flaky tuna with perfectly gooey melted cheese. Best Tuna Melt ever!!!!! The Caribbean Jerk Chicken was pretty good too but nothing compared to that perfect Tuna Melt. Earl of Sandwich..... I will never have a sandwich elsewhere. Definitely coming back whenever I'm in Vegas!! Hopefully this time I won't lose money on my way in...","review_id":"u9sYdtZjlUTDzWNqRt52xQ","stars":5,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":1,"useful":1,"user_id":"U-blmCm_qUbibUUgqDSB_g","date":"2012-04-13"},{"cool":0,"text":"I would never eat at any establishment that allowed their employees to smoke RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT! With their uniform and apron on! Not only is that gross but it's disgusting and unprofessional. I've also seen an employee use the restroom and not wash their hands. That speaks volumes on what could happen in the kitchen. My boyfriend and I play poker in that room next to it and he is completely grossed out by the employees that go in the slots to check their phone with their gloves on. YUCK!

From the way people hand them five stars and how they've earned about 1,800 reviews, it's like they're sandwich royalty!\n\nWhen a couple of my friends and I stopped by to grab a quick dinner before meeting with everyone else, we fully expected to run into a line.  Given their popularity, we figured it wouldn't be a question of \"if\" there would be a wait, but \"how long\", especially since we were going around 7:00.  Much to our surprise, there wasn't a single person ahead of us when we got there.  Score!  \n\nSince my friend and I both wanted to try a couple of their sandwiches, we decided to get two different types to share.  While she ordered The Original 1762 (Roast Beef, Sharp Cheddar, and Horseradish Sauce), I ordered the Italian (Salami, Capicola, Roasted Ham, Mortadella, Mozzarella, Roma Tomatoes, and Italian Dressing).  Even though I tried to set aside any expectations I had, it was tough trying to block out the reviews I read.  While the sandwiches were decent, they fell a little short for me.  With all the hype though, it was bound to happen.\n\n- The Original 1762 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=REJJpOEpwaK0fLvh-bKn0g) - it's essentially a roast beef sandwich, but its simplicity worked.  The roast beef and sharp cheddar were nice, but it was the horseradish sauce that did it for me - potent enough for a kick, but not enough to be harsh.  I wish the meat had been a little more medium rare than medium though.  \n- Italian (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=k8Po4fzJS9cgJcYsOdhfrw) - okay, but I think the Hot Italian at JJ Boulangerie at the Paris hotel is better (and bigger).  I liked the blend of flavors from the meat, but it was hard to separate them out.  The Roma tomatoes added some freshness, but I could have used less of them.  Ditto for the Italian Dressing.\n\nRegardless of anything else, Earl is an especially budget friendly option given its location on the Strip (sandwiches were about $7.00 each).  Plus points as well for being open 24 hours - way better for late night munchies than the 24 cafe at Paris or the bar at Bally's.  For those reasons, I'm rounding up from THREE AND A HALF to four.  Had we actually gone then (drunk) instead of for dinner (sober), I probably would have loved Earl of Sandwich.  Instead, depending on the sandwich I want, I might lean towards JJ Boulangerie instead and save my Earl trips for post drinking/clubbing adventures.","review_id":"_0-XyQuqlFKIkleAbW3CQw","stars":4,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":6,"useful":7,"user_id":"JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA","date":"2012-02-22"},{"cool":0,"text":"Got to try two sandwiches, always seen this place on yelp but finally found this place and got it\nthe price isnt vegas price so enjoy that! \n\nthe sandwich is nice and warm i think its kinda small but the rpice is good \nthe place is good! long line though but kinda fast i guess","review_id":"Z2En4IHptUUVvOqOiW4ggg","stars":4,"business_id":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"OrzYy9Z16vA7B-jSLjit7Q","date":"2014-07-08"}],"ProductID":"DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw"}
