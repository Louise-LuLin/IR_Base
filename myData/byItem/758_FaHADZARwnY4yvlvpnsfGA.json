It just screams old Vegas-smell and style alike.\n\nWe're a tourist town and the airport definitely panders to the tourist crowd. As a local I find it too flashy, but I think the tourists like all the hubbub.\n\nParking- The long term parking lots are often full and it often takes some time to find a spot, but it is a short walk to the terminal once you do find a spot. Fees for long term parking are comparable to other airports\n\nPassenger Pick-up- If you're in Terminal 1 then you are about to hate life. This is the busier terminal and they are crazy about not letting people stop (even if the person you are picking up is standing right there ready to get in the car). Terminal 3 is much more tame and will be easy.\n\nBaggage Claim- Terminal 1 is an assault on the senses. There is loud music, flashing lights, and tons of moving screens. I hate this area at Terminal 1. It makes me hate Vegas when I come here. They also take a ridiculous amount of time to send out the luggage. Terminal 3 is quiet and pleasant. It still takes forever for the luggage to come out. This is a Vegas standard.\n\nSecurity- 90% of the time this line will be long, inefficient, and frustrating. Accept it and move on to preserve your sanity.\n\nShopping & Restaurants- This will vary depending on the gate area. Sometimes there are good food and shopping options, but certain terminals have almost nothing (Southwest area unfortunately). I like that Ethel M has two locations in the airport so I can grab gifts as I leave town.","review_id":"mFmEZvHq00HV5YiyWPc81g","stars":3,"business_id":"FaHADZARwnY4yvlvpnsfGA","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w","date":"2016-02-28"},{"cool":2,"text":"Eeeeesh.

Before they installed the short term parking system, you could find a meter that had some time in it and go pick up your friends without paying for parking.

You have your Japanese tour group, your midwest country bumpkins, some wannabe gangbangers, high executive CEOs, hungover frat boys, girls doing the walk (or run) of shame to get to their gate, etc. There's such a wide range of people that fly thru here. \n\nWith that said, there's a good amount of inexperienced travelers that will hold up the TSA security line. I wish they would add more lines to accommodate the crowd. Taxi lines are horrendous and could take up to an hour of waiting. The tram can get crowded to and for some reason, when you are running late, you will always \"just missed it\". \n\nOverall this airport is just okay.

The airport you can leisurely gamble at and then grab a flight. McCarran has evolved quite a bit in the many years it has been here in Vegas providing tourists and locals flights to and fro.\n\nCurrently I work at McCarran. My job to be undisclosed. I work at the new terminal \"T3\". The new terminal is completely different from the old. It is marble, expansive, long, sterile. It's what a lot of airports look like. But once you understand the layout it makes sense. T3 also offers gambling (although in smaller capacity than T1) and it has numerous restaurants - a chop house, quite a few fast food options, a Starbucks and a Coffee Bean. It is also just a tram ride to D gates which houses many more options for dining and shopping.\n\nSince T3 replaced T2 there is no T2, so there is just T1 and T3. One day, I suppose, T2 will be referred to as some strange place that really never existed *waves hands in an eerie way*. Who knows why they didn't just make T3 the new T2? We'll never know...\n\nAs for T1 - it is in dire need of renovation, except for C-Annex and C-Gates, which houses the entire Southwest flights for the airport. A/B gates are exceptionally old, as is the security checkpoint. The whole thing should be busted up and re-created to look newer and nicer. D-Gates checkpoint is also poorly lit and stinky. The place needs a serious renovation. The actual D-Gates (which is separate from the checkpoint) is a very nice, new cosmopolitan looking establishment.\n\nParking isn't terrible, but you do have to pay the meters. It's easiest just to time it right so when you pick people up you only have to pay a few bucks. Sometimes passenger pick-up can be a hassle because those cops out there really don't like you to sit around and make you drive around and around if the people you are picking up aren't there yet.\n\nSo there you have it - the run down of McCarran.","review_id":"YWApsM7Cs7zL6-lDGP-V1Q","stars":4,"business_id":"FaHADZARwnY4yvlvpnsfGA","funny":2,"useful":4,"user_id":"hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ","date":"2013-01-20"},{"cool":1,"text":"You know your in Vegas when you have slot machines in the airport!

Slots, slots, slots, slots, slots, slots.. errrybody!\n\nWhen deciding on an airport the things you should consider are:\n#1 Do you have a choice in airports, in most cases, unless you own your own plane the answer is no.\n#2 How is the parking? At Mccarren, it's easy breezy. $14 a day for long term, and the garage is only a walkway away from the terminal.\n#3 How is passenger pick up? At Mccarren, it's pretty easy. Traffic is rarely backed up to the point that cars can't get through, and even though they say no waiting, everyone does and it doesn't seem to cause a huge problem.\n#4 How is the drop-off? At Mccarren it's like playing frogger with the taxis. You have to have a little patience and it's best to keep to the far left lane until you're close to your airline.\n#5 How is the Check-in service? If you're carrying on it's great. There are kiosks all over with every airline in that terminal all in one. Print your boarding pass and go. If you need to check your luggage you may want to consider skycap - there are a couple of counters for each airline and the lines there seem to move fast.\n#6 How is baggage claim? At Mccarren, you have to check the monitors frequently. They will often change up which carousel your bags arrive on - I think they do this to see who started their drinking on their flight in.\n#7 How is security? At Mccarren it really depends on the time of day but it's usually not too bad. If you are flying 1st or business class they have a fly-by lane. But there are several security lanes and the line seems to move fast.\n#8 How are the restaurants and shops? Mccarren, really has a little of everything. If you're craving it, they have it. Starbucks, Pretzels, Pizza, Nachos, cigars, chocolates, flavored air, etc.\n\nWhat else should you know about Mccaren? Terminal 3 is all international flights plus Alaska, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Sun Country, Virgin and United. It can be a bit confusing if you haven't flown in or out of it before. Both terminal 1 and 3 have trams that can take you to the gates, but you have to pay attention to the signs when leaving terminal 3 or you'll end up at the wrong baggage claim.\n\nTip: no matter which terminal you're flying out of, wear a pedometer - you're bound to get a ton of steps in, this airport is HUGE!","review_id":"ZbLHmi49dHnrfZf4D8bv1w","stars":4,"business_id":"FaHADZARwnY4yvlvpnsfGA","funny":3,"useful":7,"user_id":"m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ","date":"2013-04-26"},{"cool":0,"text":"Decent airport, but I do wish that they had more outlets around the airport instead of at those charging stations.

Besides their primary purpose of serving air travelers, they are a gateway to the city. Airports give travelers their first and last impression of the city. They are a reflection of the city.\n\n  McCarran is a first- rate gateway to Las Vegas. Going back to the 90s, when I flew between McCarran and New York airports, it left me with a positive first and last impression of Las Vegas. It is a reflection of the good things about Las Vegas. It is upbeat. Coming off a long flight, there is nothing more cheerful than hearing the bells of the one-arm bandits. To this day it is a welcoming sound after ending a vacation. Like Las Vegas, McCarran is modern. The monorail between terminals is one of the first to be used at an airport. Recently McCarran replaced the international terminal with a brand new state-of-the-art facility. Like Las Vegas, McCarran features plenty of fast food restaurants and Starbuck's. The list of fast food restaurants keep growing. As far as Starbuck's, they are at the majority of the terminals and even outside security at baggage claim.

Compared to other airports in the US, I would definitely rank it in the top 10.  The gates and security checkpoints are easy to navigate and I always find that the security personnel are rather friendly.\n\nHowever, for those who are just casual travelers... I WOULD STRONGLY advise printing out your boarding pass at your home or office.  Although the security lines move pretty quick, you could spend 30-45 minutes waiting in line at the ticket counters for your boarding pass- This is unavoidable for casual travelers who need to check bags. You will also save a substantial amount of time if you opt to fly with only carry-on/personal items. Vegas knows how to handle a line efficiently, however lines can be extremely long since Vegas is so popular.\n\nOn the bright side, McCarran offers slot machines around every corner (for the gamblers) - which is nice if there is an unexpected delay.  They also offer free wifi for travelers and they have several food options that are spread out within the airport (with more options being added quickly for the expansion). \n\nThe Best Part?  Everyone who lands here is so excited and it's one of the best part of living in Vegas. The energy is almost palpable and I truly enjoy their upbeat spirit when I land.

These gates don't offer a lot in terms of food or enough places to sit, but security is always a breeze to get through.  Another security checkpoint takes you to the C gate, which is an old run down hallway that Southwest uses.  Security is easy to get through, but from what I remember the food choices include several fast food joints ($10 Subway footlongs- yikes) and Cabo Wabo.  They are currently remodeling this gate.  The final security checkpoint takes you to the D gates, which is the newest area of the airport.  Security takes a little longer to get through, but the terminal is bright and fancy and has nice stores and restaurants.  My planes never leave from the D gates.  Sigh.\n\nIn all, if you follow the signs overhead it's easy to find where you need to go.  Security is pretty easy to deal with and I've never waited an insane amount of time in line, even during the holiday season.  Sunday afternoons can be pretty busy though, so give yourself a little more time if your plane is leaving on a Sunday.  \n\nDriving to the airport is easy, parking is easy- it's super close to the strip so it's convenient.

There are only a handful of casinos on the strip, so you are bound to find someone else to share a cab with.\n\nNot the best airport in terms of food choices, sitting, or overall looks, but certainly one of the easiest to deal with.

I like airports in general, and McCarran is no exception. An Ethel M chocolate store, flat escalators, easy navigation throughout the airport, and clean- features in the airport that make me excited to travel from this airport. Of course, it wouldn't be the main Vegas airport without a view of the Strip, slot machines and billboards of shows and hotels. The food options are limited and overpriced. I tried the Mexican restaurant here, and it was not good. I also tried the TCBY/pretzel place, which was okay. \n\nDropping off someone at the airport is usually hassle-free. You can park your car at the designated airline section, and help your someone unload their luggage, say your farewells, and watch them leave. But watch out for reckless drivers especially the taxis, and pedestrians in this area. \nPicking up someone at the airport is usually my least favorite part of this airport. You could park at short-term parking and wait for your someone at baggage claim or across the other side of the entrance, but this requires a few dollars. Another option is to try your luck and time your someone's arrival exactly, so you can do a fast pick up at the passenger pick-up area. But don't be surprised when a security guard comes with an attitude for you to move. \nIf you're traveling alone, I would suggest parking in the economy lot and taking the shuttle to the airport to save money.

Depending on which airline you fly, you may have to take the tram to the D terminal (United gates). Since it is Vegas, there are slot machines everywhere if you care to gamble to pass the time waiting for your flight. There is a decent selection of food options but like any airport, could be better. I do wish that they had more efficient TSA and security, especially for those of us that travel frequently.

I get dropped off at the main entrance and quickly make my way to security without issue.  The lines flow quickly for the most part and sometimes I even come across some friendly TSA agents (though they can be hard to spot).  Depending on which terminal I am flying from I get to see some cool stuff.  When flying Southwest out of the C Gates I get to see the old McCarran that I grew to know as a kid flying out here as an unaccompanied minor to visit my dad.  It brings back good memories.  If I fly to SFO on a different airline (United, Continental, etc) I fly out of the D Gates.  They are much newer and cleaner than C Gates and feel like a mall.  It has a very modern look.  And I love the tram than takes me to the D Gates.  It starts above ground and ends underground.  It is like a mini subway here in Vegas.  Its one of those little things in life that makes me happy.  As for coming home, the trams from both C and D Gates drop you right near baggage claim and it is an easy exit from there.  Usually my dad is waiting there for me.  I have taken the bus and that was a bit of a pain.  I had a hard time finding the bus platform.  Just follow the signs and you'll be fine.  It just may take some time, thats all.\n\nFor my hatred of McCarran, picking up incoming passengers as opposed to being one.  I have picked up a buddy of mine twice and both times we kept missing each other with the couple of different bridges from baggage claim to the parking structure.  One time he walked on the  lower bridge all the while I was on the opposite.  The next time he walked the upper.  The confusion did not end there either.  You have different levels of the parking structure with the same number.  Like Level 2 and Level 2M.  Its not just a different section but a totally differnent level.  People on the elevator get lost all the time and end up getting off too soon and getting right back on.  I learned my lesson from picking up my friend so yesterday when I had to pick up my aunt I went in to baggage claim and waited for her.  There are so many escalators for people to come down I did not know where to watch for her.  I nearly missed her despite my best effort.  Nevertheless I did find her and we retrieved her luggage quickly and it was back out to the parking lot of doom.  I should have used the \"Pay Here\" kiosks to get out of the parking lot but no, I left the ticket in my car.  So I proceeded to the pay booths at the exit.  One lane was open that was accepting cash.  I got in that line and sat for nearly 15 minutes before I relaized it was not moving.  I don't know if the front car was broken down or if it was just some idiot fishing for loose change.  Either way it was frustrating.  I ended up at a kiosk at the exit and using a card to pay.  A card a put in the direction indicated by the picture on the machine.  It was the wrong way.  A quick turn around and my aunt and I were finally off.  \n\nI much prefer to be a passenger at McCarran.  That is the way to go.","review_id":"FjkYvzZ10C1Mupqq-a51Ug","stars":4,"business_id":"FaHADZARwnY4yvlvpnsfGA","funny":3,"useful":1,"user_id":"eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw","date":"2014-01-30"},{"cool":0,"text":"This airport is so convenient to the Strip.

For as much traffic as this place gets, I had higher hopes.  That's not to say that my experiences here were bad, but I wasn't impressed overall.\n\nVIVA LAS VEGAS!!!!!  Ok, now that I have THAT out of the way, let me tell you how my time here went....\n\nFor starters, I few southwest, so I came in and out of the same terminal both times. The second time I was here, I noticed that they are building (or have built) another terminal.  Interesting.\n\nOn first impressions, I thought \"wow, this place is kind of small compared to other places I have been\" and totally not what I was expecting for Las Vegas. Phoenix's airport is 10 times bigger, cleaner and has a ton more restaurants' then this!  Even Detroit's new airport is bigger!  pfft.\n\nThere were some places to shop at, but the airport seemed to be overloaded with slot machines.  I've heard about this before, but still thought it was kind of cool to actually see in person.  I could even see them from the airplane once we pulled into the gate!  The downside?  Lack of seating while waiting for your gate!  I would have rather had a few more seats if you ask me, and for as busy at this place is, I would have liked some additional chairs!  So many people here!\n\nThey had a few places to eat in here, but again, I didn't see many places to sit. The terminal was long and skinny, and I didn't have enough time to wander and study the whole thing.  I love that I was able to get off and go right into the smoking lounge without having to buy a drink. It's literally right between gates C6 and C8.  Awesome!  Slot machines in there too!\n\nThe staff I interacted with were friendly, outgoing and what I would expect for Las Vegas. Not uptight, but not overly laid back either.  Definitely fun, that's for sure!  \n\nThis airport isn't bad, and serves it's purpose. Hey, I've seen some smaller crazier airports in my day, but really I wish they would step up their game a little bit. How about if instead of 900 commercials everyday about visiting Las Vegas, you pump it up at the airport? \n\nIf I come here again I might rate it higher, but for now, a solid three stars.","review_id":"REXypjAcULFv_4TVbAn6oQ","stars":3,"business_id":"FaHADZARwnY4yvlvpnsfGA","funny":1,"useful":3,"user_id":"qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ","date":"2014-10-14"},{"cool":0,"text":"I love this airport!

In classic Las Vegas fashion, this airport is occupied by stores, both name brand and not, and slots throughout its floor. Luckily the airport is no smoking so the lingering atmosphere of cigarettes and vapor don't bathe your clothes as you walk its empty hallways.\n\nThe BEST parts of the airport has to do with how clean it feels, the large ceilings, and the shuttle system they have from one terminal to another. It feels very organized and easy to maneuver around. They even have a tube system from one of its terminals back to the main one.\n\nHowever, there are some serious issues to this airport. One of the biggest is how confusing it is to find the pick up area when you land. Unlike most major airports where you can go curbside next to your check in carrousel and be picked up this space is nonexistent. Depending on which terminal you exit out of you have to either go to the parking structure or try to navigate an empty space between shuttle and taxi lines that stretch forever. It is a nightmare for first time flyers out to Las Vegas and even more so for those who try picking you up who've never done so in Vegas. Another issue is if you rent a car, though convenient to be able to pick up and drop off your vehicle all in one central hub, to get there feels very distant and round-about when driving towards the airport. You'll want to definitely give yourself at least an extra half hour to get here.\n\nAll in all McCarran International Airport gets the job done with some great ideas but some awful ones along the way. Once you get used to the airport it'll get easier but for first timers make sure you have patience before starting your Las Vegas trip.","review_id":"uKq6W2cS6NzKLEM_ZeOeSA","stars":3,"business_id":"FaHADZARwnY4yvlvpnsfGA","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"ofMESFOXORl9Ng5KGGf4kg","date":"2016-06-20"},{"cool":1,"text":"Vegas is a regular getaway place for me.

Thanks for paying my taxes all you non-locals. \n\nCONS: \n- Traffic. This airport is near the Strip so traffic can be crazy. Get here early!\n- If you're late the lines can be staggering. \n- Dealing over eager drunk tourists. \n- Dealing with hung-over and broke tourists.\n- Drinks. Like I said before bars ever five feet. I have definitely missed a flight or two because of cheap drinks at the bar. \n- Not a 24 airport. I think flights stop at 11pm. \n- Slot machines. The loud \"woohoos\" and ringing of those ridiculous money making machines. \n\nAlcohol and flying through air.

Bright, cheery, easy on and off cab service, usually quick and efficient security lines, FREE wifi, quick tram to baggage area, and super easy to get to as it is right in the city. Yes, you can make a quick escape with your big winnings, or make a break for it with your last few dollars.\n\nAt least this airport has a sense of humor, as seen by the check in videos at security while waiting on line.

Actually, it felt like I spent more time there then my real house do to all the traveling I used to do. Anyway, even though I am writing about my home airport, does not mean I have to love it by any means. Below is what I love and hate about all things McCarran A/P:\n\nLove:\n\n-It is close to my house and close to all things Las Vegas. \n\n-Parking prices are reasonable if you have to leave your car for an extended period of time. \n\n-The accessibility of the airport is quite good between the 215 freeway and Tropicana or Russell. \n\n-Terminal D kicks ass! It's the newest terminal with all the best goodies! It has the best selection of food, lots of natural light, and is just overall, a comfortable place to be relative to the rest of the airport. \n\n-Southwest (USAir used to) uses McCarran as a hub airport. \n\n-The random fact they have a 24-hour fitness gym here. \n\n-Slot/Video poker machines. (I used to ritually put in $10 and play every time I went to the airport to pass the time and hopefully get my trip paid for. After my years of donations, you would think they would rename a gate or even bench after me :)\n\nWhat I hate:\n\n-Terminals A&B are older then dirt and show it. \n\n-Lack of food choices within terminals A&B and even C (granted C has done some remodeling and has a few better restaurants to choose from)\n\n-Just the drab feel of the airport in general. Hell.... even Terminal 2, the charter/international/hawaii terminal feels old, dreary and depressing. \n\nAfter all is said and done though, McCarran airport is still home for me and my gateway to the rest of the country and world.","review_id":"0xp46PKiKjcL22lpmbDy9g","stars":3,"business_id":"FaHADZARwnY4yvlvpnsfGA","funny":1,"useful":3,"user_id":"AwotTxzd_M5ZevluUUVkwQ","date":"2010-04-06"},{"cool":2,"text":"What can one really review about an airport?

I like that McCarran is located right next to UNLV and only about a 10 minute drive to the Strip. McCarran itself is like a teaser for out-of-town guests. Slot machines are littered throughout the airport and clips for big name shows are played on repeat on huge TV screens. Short-term parking is the way to go for quick drop offs. If you're parked for less than 15 minutes it's free, but I usually end up paying $2-4 when picking up or dropping off family and friends. You pay for parking on level 2 where the main walkway is, or on level 2M Excalibur. Long-term parking is $16 per day. Ouch. Try to have someone drop you off at the airport so you can avoid paying long-term parking if you're going to be out of town for a few days. The McCarran Airport is clean and spacious. There's charging stations for all your tech equipment located near the gates and moving walkways to help get you where you need to go quicker.

We arrived over two hours early, to be met with what looked like a reasonably sized line at check-in. In a few moments, we realized that the line abruptly broke off and wrapped around the back of the building. We made our way to the end of the line, but, 45 minutes later, when we reached the point where the line split to make way for people entering the building, a shuffling mishap by a security guard caused us to get turned around on the way to the next part of the line. \n\nWhen we tried to explain what happened to another security guard, he thought we were trying to jump ahead in the line and sent us to the back. We tried to explain what had happened, along with the ten people with us who had also gotten turned around, and he refused to listen. We wound up back at the end of the line.\n\nWe missed our flight, and when we explained what was happening to the check-in attendant, she told us that we could fly stand-by, but that it was unlikely we would get a flight today, because they were overbooked as it was. She said that for an additional two hundred dollars a piece, we could guarantee a spot on another flight, and in the future, we should get to the airport more than an hour in advance. When we told her when we arrived, she said that it was impossible that we had been there for two hours, because the line was only 45 minutes long. We showed her our taxi receipt, and she got on the phone with her manager, saying that we had ALLEGEDLY gotten here two hours earlier and had been to the back of the line multiple times due to an ALLEGED mishap. \n\nA manager finally came out, looked at our receipts, and okay-ed the sale of the tickets at no additional cost, but the attendant rolled her eyes and used the world ALLEGEDLY about seventeen times. Taking a half hour to resolve our issue no doubt held up the line even further, and caused other people delays in their travel. \n\nMeanwhile, as we were waiting, the disorganization of the line allowed multiple people to jump to the front.

Honestly, I would say most if not all will have a 3 star rating from me. Why? Well every airport has certain things that stick out so that you know what city that you are in. None of them have anything that impresses me.\n\nOf course since its sin city you have slot machines every where. Even the designated smokers lounge which is a rectangular clear glass room has them. I call this place the \"Cancer Room\". These fools look like animals in cages at a zoo. On some days, you can barely see anything in here. It would make Cheech and Chong proud.\n\nThere is free wifi all through out but if you are waiting at your gate to board and EVERYBODY is either on their phone or laptop, the connection is very slow. Just to check my email it took minutes instead of seconds. I ended up just using my data because aint nobody got time for that slow bandwidth. \n\nRestaurants and concessions here are highly marked up which just might be worse than getting it off the strip itself. How do these people sleep at night when a basic burger, fries, and a drink is 15 bucks? I say boycott all of them but then again, are you gonna be able to wait the 2 or 3 plus hours to board your flight and get food at your destination which could be more hours added? So I guess if you dont want to pass out, you are forced to get something to eat here. You are at the mercy of the greed that is the high prices of the airport concessions.\n\nThere are some things to be thankful for though. At some gates there are plenty of outlets for you to charge your phone or laptop. That is if you are lucky enough to be at a gate that has that. Otherwise, you are fighting over one single outlet and more often than not, you have to sit on the floor for that particular outlet is nowhere near any chairs.\n\nLastly, I cant end this without talking about the TSA. For me, its hit or miss. You will either get an anal security person or one that is pleasant. You almost have to strip down to your underwear just to walk through the metal detector or the one machine that they make you hold your arms above your head like you're under arrest. Thanks to that one idiot that had plans to blow up the plane by allegedly putting some kind of explosives in his shoes. Because of that, you have people with some seriously stanky feet when they take their shoes off. What, did you guys decide to play a full court game of basketball before taking off for somewhere? \n\nSo there you have it. This review can be applied to just about any airport in the country. I dont think there is such a thing as a perfect airport.

The whole airport is clean, the restaurant/quick stop areas are great and plentiful. There are tons of taxis always waiting...and at some point I KNOW they will get the monorail to be extended to the airport, which will be a dream come true honestly, it would be such a freggin busy monorail and so great for the environment too!

Ok I am going to break this down now. \n\nSecurity:\nWe all have to take our shoes off and go through security. That can either be a very painful experience or it can be easy. Even though it is unpredictable I can say for all the times I have come here it has been easy. they have a system and they know how to move people through security quickly. the agents there really do not want to waste any time. They just wanna get people through and on their way. The only delays really come from people who are not prepared. \n\nRestaurants and shops:\nThis airport has plenty of restaurants and shops. They have the small little generic gift shops and they also have really nice high end type stores where you can get clothes, shoes and handbags. They have a good mix of fast food type places and sit down type places. Be aware that they charge airport prices though so get ready to pay more. \n\nNavigation:\nThis airport is really easy to navigate through. They have plenty of signs pointing you in the right direction. It is hard to get lost here. they have plenty of elevators, moving walkways, and escalators to help you get where you are going faster as well. Also getting out is easy. They have one area for people picking you up, another for taxis, and another for shuttles. It is very easy to get in and out. \n\nOverall this is a great airport.

The taxi stand has a long line and marked pick-up stalls of at least 30. The newest major change in the past couple of years is the new off-site rental car center, where all the main companies are located about a 10 - 15 minute ride south of  the airport.

Most weren't worth a comment, some were amazing and others were terrifying.  Overall, I have to say Las Vegas gets it right with McCarran.  It's not a surprise, nor should it be.  Vegas' life blood is tourism and the airport can make or break just how healthy we really are.  With Terminal 3 open now, the airport seems less congested.  For that matter, T3 is a quiet and open experience when compared to the longstanding Terminal 1.  Both terminals have ample parking:  covered short-term and long-term, economy, and now the addition of a cell phone lot for those times you need to wait.  No more orbiting the airport over and over!\n\nFor visitors to Vegas:  your auditory and visual experience beings at the airport.  After you weave your way through your arrival terminal and enter the baggage claim area in T1, you're awash in the sights and sounds of fabulous Las Vegas with slot machines and big screens all around presenting you with continuous advertisements for all the shows you might want to see.  Wade in and enjoy it, then catch your shuttle, limo, cab or Uber to your hotel and enjoy.  If you're landing and retrieving your luggage in Terminal 3, it's a much more traditional (non Vegas) experience, but don't worry, I'm sure this'll change as T3 matures.  Welcome to Vegas and thank you for being here instead of somewhere else!\n\nFinal thought:  the airport is amazingly quiet if you're making an early morning departure.  I've done this for most of my trips and love that there's rarely a line at the airlines for check-in, and at the security checkpoint.  When there is, it's hardly worth mentioning.

Okay, back then I couldn't even put one damn quarter in but, oh well, what the hell do I care, I'm in VEGAS biatches!!!  Well, let's just say that my many trips to and from McCarran after that was all a blur cause I was NEVER sober coming or going.\n\nFast forward to 2004 and I now live in Vegas and where do I happen to work? At McCarran! So what I'm gonna break down to you, take it to heart..after working at McCarran for over 6 years and at all the checkpoints, I kinda know it like the back of my hand, so I'm gonna try and get as in-depth as I can.\n\nBusy travel days: Thursday, Friday, Sunday and Monday are busier than the rest of the week so keep in mind to give yourself plenty of time if you are traveling out on these days.  I would recommend getting to the airport at least 1 1/2 hrs just to give yourself some cushion (2 hrs if there is a large convention in town) unless you are the type that likes the last minute heart pumping energy rush of maybe missing your flight and begging to cut the lines while everyone rolls their eyes at you...Busy travel times- Mornings tend to be busier then evening flights so if you can, book your flights for later in the day.\n\nCheckpoints- A/B Gates, can get busy but since it's the smallest of the three checkpoints doesn't have such a long wait line as the other checkpoints. \nC Gates services mostly Southwest Airlines so on certain dates (see busy travel days above) can also get pretty busy as Southwest probably has the most flights in/out of Vegas.  There are actually three ways to access C Gates now, one lane at the D gates and now, a connection to A/B gates so even if you went through A/B you can access C gates after security.  There is also the new C Annex located at the end of ticketing by the Southwest counters and has plenty of lanes and also allows you access to the A/B gates since they are now connected after you get through security.\nD Gates is the busiest of all the checkpoints as they service all the major carriers (United, Delta, Continental, American, Alaska, and a few others).  Again, refer to the busy travel days and give yourself plenty of time.\n\nFood- YES, there is food after you get through security...I really don't know why people ask that question over and over again..don't all airports have food/drink/bars/lounges by your gates?? Why would McCarran be any different?  Are there better restaurants at certain gates? Well- it really depends on you right?  Burger King is king at McCarran so don't bother looking for a McDonald's cause there is none. Sit down restaurants? Sure there are some but nothing notable except Chili's at the A/B gates... Also, keep in mind that some of these places close early during the week as it can get pretty dead some nights, so if you are traveling out on a red eye on a Weds night, you might want to pick up something on the way since you probably won't have a lot of options.\n\nBathrooms! Okay so here's the deal, at D Gates, the bathrooms are BEFORE security, once you get through security, there are NO bathrooms until you get off the tram to the gates SO if you gotta go, then you need to do it before you start lining up. A/B gates, there are bathrooms close by both before and after security, the same goes for C Annex Gates.  Now- as far as where the cleaner bathrooms are, D gates is kept up okay, same with A/B gates.  C Annex bathrooms before security only has 4 stalls and can get pretty nasty so I would advise you wait until after you get through security and use the bathrooms by the gates as they tend to be cleaner.\n\nBaggage claim- can be a nightmare cause it seems like the airlines are always changing which carousel your bags are coming out on after they tell you so just check the monitors when you get down there before you ask us, cause some of us don't work for the airlines so asking us where your bags will be arriving will only get a blank stare as we point you to the direction of the monitors that tells you which carousel to look for...\n\nTaxis are readily available but that taxi queue can get pretty long when there is a large convention in town (CES and AVN together is always a mess) and can cost a pretty penny ($20-$30) but gets you to your destination quicker than the shuttle.  Airport Shuttles are cheaper ($7 per person one way) and you have to ride with others as they stop to drop off people along the way so depending on your needs, you can make the call.\n\nOverall, McCarran has some good, some bad, and definitely some ugly, especially on Sundays when people are coming through hung-over or still drunk...whatever you do though, please don't put your face or body on those carpets...I couldn't tell you the last time I saw someone clean them, but I sure have seen people up-chuck on them!!\nStay safe folks and have a good flight!!","review_id":"NfaHoLVtuxxJIwhqKviM9A","stars":3,"business_id":"FaHADZARwnY4yvlvpnsfGA","funny":3,"useful":4,"user_id":"LltbT_fUMqZ-ZJP-vJ84IQ","date":"2011-02-24"},{"cool":6,"text":"Who doesn't like that there are slot machines at an airport.

I find if convenient to pick people up (though it can be confusing before you know the layout). \n\nFlying out of Macarran is always a breeze. I have rarely experienced a huge line at security and generally the lines move very quickly. There are tons of places to eat and shop once you get through security. \n\nThis is an airport for people watchers. First of all people come to Las Vegas from all over the world so there are so many different types of people to look at. Secondly, in Las Vegas, people visiting tend to wear the most gaudy, tiny, see through, sequin covered, outfit. Words like age and weather appropriate go out the window. They then pair said outfit with the craziest and often highest heels they own which makes for an excellent show. Lastly, inhibitions are abandoned and, most likely, they've been drinking since they boarded their plane to Vegas. Therefore you are left with people of every color of the rainbow, running around drunk looking like they got dressed in a cross between Liberace and Cher's closet. All of this equates to the best people watching experience you will ever have. \n\nFinally, this airport has something that I've never seen in any other airport, slot machines.  So if the shopping and people watching isn't keeping you entertained, and you haven't already lost your life savings, you can pull up a seat and try your luck at some last minute winnings. \n\nIf you are flying into Las Vegas, our baggage claim area is huge and very efficient. You won't have to wait long for a bag. Ground Transportation is also pretty simple. The taxi line may look forever long but it's lightening quick.  Most importantly, our airport sits right next to the fabulous Las Vegas strip so the ride to your hotel should be short. \n\nGood luck while visiting!","review_id":"h3ILqTIixtwFNVIuh5wE_Q","stars":5,"business_id":"FaHADZARwnY4yvlvpnsfGA","funny":2,"useful":2,"user_id":"jOX6aVwI9sA-sQFWBZSsFw","date":"2014-10-28"},{"cool":7,"text":"Pro: You can gamble (slots) in this airport when there is a delay.\nCon: You can lose money in this airport when there is a delay.\n\nPro: Several food options are spread throughout the terminal.\nCon: None of these places are places I really want to eat at.\n\nPro: The airport is so close to the Strip that you think you might be landing on the Strip during approach.\nCon: It's still a $40 cab ride from the airport to the Strip.\n\nPro: Vegas knows how to handle a line efficiently.\nCon: Lines for everything are long.\n\nSo, it's not the worst airport I've ever flown into, but it isn't exactly awesomesauce either.

A model display of airplanes that have passed through LAS, an exhibit on the operational history of the airport, and a well preserved Hacienda Airlines Cessna 172 are just some of the few things that make this airport great for an aviation buff like me.\n\nWhen you get to the gate area, however, it's a completely different story. This is a common occurence with Southwest at most airports, but I could definitely feel it here a lot more than at OAK or ONT for example. Southwest gate areas are always heavily overcrowded. People sitting on the floor not giving a shit about who has to walk around them, while they stare at you for walking around with a camera and taking photos of airplanes taxiing by.

Simple solution.\n\n-  Get out your notebook - There is FREE internet access in the terminals.  Can kill a lot of time surfing the internet ... \n\n-  Bring snack foods with you - Give shops are slim pickings.

TSA Pre - If you travel enough, sign up for the TSA Pre system. The office is located near the entrance to Gate C.  If you qualify, it will save you tons of money in the long run.\n\nb.  Dropping off - If you have friends and family that are either arriving or departing from D/C gates in Terminal 1, always drop them off or pick them up from Passenger Pick up, if they have only HANDCARRY.  If they have check in, you don't have choice but to drop them off at the departure areas of the airlines.\n\nc.  Picking up - If you are picking people up, just be careful and park it at the short term or go around. The traffic nazis are in force and will make you move!\n\nd.  The terminals - I think all the terminals are fine. Terminal 1 is a bit older but really the shopping, food choices and waiting areas are decent. Terminal 3 is very new and modern and very pleasant.\n\ne.  Getting Around - Them little shuttle trains work out well. Baggage comes very quick whereas before, it took forever.\n\nThere is a TSA pre office here, there is the GOES inspectors if you want a GOES permit and there are a lot of services here that make this a world class airport.

With all the travel I do I've had the absolute worst experiences with Southwest here in Vegas. Dealing with them feels like dealing with TSA's. Like they are not hear to do you any favors and your one step from being strip searched and denied travel. Then when I've tried to ask for their full name or badge numbers they refuse to tell me.

And I am very familiar with airports and McCarran is actually pretty good.   They handle a huge number of passengers daily.   And one must remember the passengers you see at McCarran tend to be tourist who are not used to traveling on a regular basis.  So, they move a bit slower and they get confused because they are unfamiliar.   But the airport does a great job of moving them in and out of where they want to be.    The flights tend to be on time, but a small hiccup can take a long time to clear out due to the huge volume of people coming in and out of Las Vegas.   \nLike most airports, there are plenty of places to grab something to eat or drink.   They even have an oxygen bar to help you recover enough for your flight home.   The security lines actually move at a decent speed, so that's good.   I am bummed they moved the car rental lots away from the airport to a central rental center a few miles from the airport.   It adds a little time to process of travel, but it reduces the overall traffic.   Also, on the positive side, they do offer free wifi, but I find the wifi to be hit and miss.\nFor fun, when you arrive at McCarran, you can spot the people leaving, they look tired, very tired.   And when you get ready to depart from McCarran, you can spot the people just arriving, they have all sorts of crazy energy.   It's fun to watch. \nWill I be back?   Heck yeah!

Major panic attack, because although I am late more often than I would like to be I freak out whenever I am late. SO damn those subway things for giving me a heart attack every time. EVERY TIME. \nOne thing though I love flying in because I really feel that I have made it to Vegas with this airport. The constant advertisements everywhere for shows on the strip and the gross slot machines and the hot muggy air when I first get off the plane and head into the airport.

I think the people watching part is the most entertaining because you literally see all kinds of people with so many different agendas.  If you are flying out of this airport, I highly recommend getting there at least two hours early.  The security lines can be insane, especially on a busy weekend.  If you are flying into the airport, I recommend getting one of the shuttles to your hotel as the taxi lines can be like the line to Space Mountain at Disneyland on a weekend in the Summer.  I've stood in line for a taxi for over an hour before.  It's not the lack of taxis as the line is constantly moving, it's just the sheer number of people who need a taxi.

San Jose is close to my favorite.  \n\n1) parking ...passenger pick up is always a nightmare.  In order to avoid a headache of clueless people I recommend to park in short term parking.  You can wait there and if it's less than 15 minutes it's free!  If more people did this it would actually free up space by the curb for those who's passenger is waiting for their ride rather than the ride waiting for their passenger. When flying I always park in long term parking and pay the extra few bucks to have the convince of getting off the plane and walking straight to my car rather than waiting for a shuttle to take me to a lot 10 or so minutes away.  If you end up tipping the shuttle driver the price is only a few dollars difference.  Completely worth it to park in long term parking. Compared to California LA airport parking prices in Vegas are cheap! So this is a plus but now to the bad.\n\n2) terminals.  Love love love the new terminal.  Hate hate hate the old. The great thing is for us healthy people you get to do a lot of walking.  It seems from parking to ticketing to gate its back and forth and retracting steps. Old terminal very dark. Carpets are old and dirty. Why people think it's ok to allow their kids to crawl all over the floor is beyond me.  The new terminal is much brighter and feels more open.  No carpet there.  This statement is for b and c gates...get more outlets!!!! Charging stations by the bathroom away for the gate is annoying.  Other airports have power outlets in the seats by their gate.  Amazing concept. \n\n3) food selection.  Guess this depends on the gate so I'm referencing this review for b and c gates.  It's terrible!!! So sick of fast food greasy selections.  I look at the people in line for these places and think ...wow.  Here's a news flash... You will get fat if you eat fatty foods. I did manage to get a yogurt and a banana today at one of the side carts. A good banana too!  First time I saw good quality fruit. See my picture. \n\nOverall this airport needs to remodel and update.  Hotels on the strip are constantly improving, the airport needs to follow their lead.

Not because it was fancy or nice (cuz it's mostly not), but because they have slot machines by the gates!  Certainly beats just sitting around (though it's potentially quite a bit more expensive...).  I even remember telling myself that \"if I were to ever have a long delay, I would want it to be here\".  \n\nFast forward years later and I realized...I wanted to kick my own ass for jinxing myself.  A nine hour delay and a terrible hangover will do that to you.  The food vouchers we were given helped, but there weren't a lot of appetizing options near our gate to spend them on.  A sub shop and Starbucks were just about it.\n\nFast forward another few years and I was pleasantly surprised to see Virgin America had been moved into the newly built Terminal 3.  Needless to say, it's a huge improvement and much more appealing to fly in and out of - better dining options, spacious and clean, and a ton of outlets for charging devices.\n\nSince it was built detached from the main/older airport terminals though, splitting cabs isn't as convenient as it used to be if you're not going to the same terminal.  There's no direct access by foot between the two and the cab fare going from one to the other runs about $5-10 (though there's a shuttle between the two).  Seems pretty crazy to me!
