I came back again and fell in love. \n\nMon Ami Gabi is located inside Paris hotel but their outside patio is right on the strip.  They are always busy so try to come at off times if you're planning to dine here for lunch or dinner.  I've only been here for lunch on the weekends but I'd definitely recommend this spot to anyone who's never been.\n\nMy boyfriend and I shared:\nOnion Soup Au Gratin & Prime Steak Sandwich upon recommendation.\n\nThey also give you bread and butter to start off with which is always a plus in my book.\nI also noticed they had a Bloody Mary Bar in the middle of the restaurant that I thought was interesting.  If I was a bigger Bloody Mary fan I would've been down to try it but perhaps next time.\n\nThe Onion Soup Au Gratin was a lot bigger than expected and boy was I glad!  Definitely one of the top French Onion soups I've ever had--the soup had a savory flavor with onions, bread and tons of melted cheese.  The warm bread they bring out to you while you wait, also pairs well with this soup.  Must get!\n\nThe Prime Steak Sandwich was amaaaaaazing.  I was so happy I went with this recommendation as it did not disappoint one bit! We asked for our steak to be medium rare and it came out with peppercorn mayo and tons of carmelized onions.  Everything complemented each other and each bite was better than the first.  The steak was so tender and juicy... and the buns they used were warm and soft.  The sandwich also came out with fries too which were good but nothing special.  I actually prefer my fries to be a bit more crispier.  \n\nThe service was excellent and there isn't really anything to complain about except I do wish the tables were a bit further apart from each other.  Maybe it's just me but it feels like all the tables are closely set to each other and a bit crammed.  The prices are a bit steep but then again, it is Vegas so it's expected.  I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch.","review_id":"s9vOLOeb2UBl2FxyK6vQug","stars":4,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":1,"useful":1,"user_id":"dR_rEskmBSyY3AuI-84dUQ","date":"2015-05-06"},{"cool":2,"text":"What a wonderful place for lunch!!

I highly recommend making a reservation - they will take you very quickly if you do. I've never had to wait more than 5 min. if I made a reservation; going in on a Friday night without a reservation was about an hour wait. That's to be expected. You usually wait longer for a patio table, because of its excellent views, but I say skip it if you've seen the fountains - the inside is usually quiet and calm, so it makes for a much more relaxing meal.\n\nYou hungry after that wait? No problem. They're going to bring you a fresh baguette with an amuse-bouche that you'll dream about for months. For an appetizer, get the brie and put it on that delicious bread. They only give you four crostinis with the brie, which can seem a little chintzy, but with the bread there, you have plenty of carbs to put your brie on.\n\nI've taken vegetarian friends and carnivorous friends here alike and they've all found something delicious on the menu. I highly recommend the filet mignon in merlot butter - it comes with crispy chipped fries which are the perfect combination of fry and potato chip. \n\nHonestly, I've never made it to dessert, because I've been so stuffed after savoring every last bite of my filet.

Bizarre, perhaps, but a lifelong tradition I have no interest in stopping any time soon.\n\nOn my most recent trip, my friend and I were discussing which wonderful, carnivorous eatery to frequent.  I mentioned a couple of my long-time favorites, and she countered with Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nHer selling point was excellent steak on a budget.  Fair enough, I'm always up for trying something new.  \n\nWe had a reservation and were seated promptly.  They let us choose between indoor or outdoor seating.  It was 10 million degrees outside (no exaggeration!) so we opted for inside.  The setting was quaint, very bistro-in-the-real-paris-with-much-higher-ceilings.  Our waiter was *awesome*.  He excelled at flirting 101, but not in an annoying way.\n\nWe both ordered the steak frites.  The beef was good, the sauce (you get to choose one) was disappointing (I had the bordelaise) and I was glad I ordered it on the side.  My friend loved her mushroom sauce.  The fries were amazing.  Possibly the best ever.\n\nOther selling points: I wasn't in a wine mood, as I had already had a couple of drinks elsewhere before dinner, and our waiter poured me a glass on the house.  The carrot tapenade and baguette were fabulous.  There were nickel slots outside the front door.  Okay, nix the last one.\n\nTo sum it up, good steak, good price, not my favorite in Vegas... but Daniel is now my favorite waiter in all of Nevada.\n\nFinally, I wish I could comment on dessert, but I was determined to have my Vegas cheesecake at Carnegie Deli after Crique de Soleil.

Flawlessly accompanied by butter and a carrot slaw to spread on your bread. The fish of the day was Barramundi with pole beans over a light tomato sauce. It was cooked perfectly, with a nice crisp skin, seasoning was excellent on my fish as well as my vegetables. My husband ordered the chefs special of the day which was a Prime Rib Roast with long beans and scalloped potatoes. He ate every morsel, the only thing I tasted were the potatoes, which I thought were a bit peppery for my taste. Everyone else in our group seemed to love their food, some of the orders included Trout Almondine, Steak, Seafood Platter, Shrimp cocktail, Sea Scallops, and Onion Soup just to name a few.\nFor dessert we ordered Creme Brulee to share, it was an enjoyable ending to our meal, light creamy vanilla custard with a nicely caramelized top layer.

My standard eggs Benedict was savory and delicious.  The coffee was abundant and rich.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and not much was said once we got the food, which is a sign of a great meal.  I will definitely come back again.","review_id":"6bvKiRm1FbzcG-y3OB5aGA","stars":5,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"_elcfpLgcSGYISI0MlYONQ","date":"2014-04-24"},{"cool":2,"text":"There was a Mon Ami Gabi around my area in DC, and though I was curious, the menu was never enticing enough.  I eventually moved away without having ever tried it.  I noticed that MAG Las Vegas had a lot of good reviews, so last night we finally dined here.  Wow, I've been srsly missing out.\n\nThe menu was basically steak and then everything else.  Unfortunately, we had been grazing all day, so we were not able to order all we wanted.  What we did get:\n\nMussels- The full order was a little less than $30, and for an appetizer, it was more than enough for the two of us.  To me, the sauce was a little under-salted, but otherwise, very good.  I believe it had some sherry cream base and generous slices of garlic.  It paired really well with our first baguette, which was quite hard.  9/10\n\nBurrata- This is an un-matured cheese...basically, you make a pouch in a mozzarella ball and fill it with curd and cream.  I thought the brininess of the olive tapenade countered the fresh, but otherwise almost neutral  taste of the cheese well.  I asked for more baguette to eat with this, since the three toast points this came with was not enough.  The second baguette was very soft, and I could not get enough of this and the burrata.  I'm very much a fat and carb addict, so I could've eaten this for my entree; it was so good!  My only issue was that at almost $15, this dish was a little over-priced.  9/10\n\nSkate- We chose this as our entree, b/c this is one item that I won't be making at home anytime soon.  In fact, I think the last time we had this was in Kuala Lumpur ages ago.  I just don't see this on the menu in the States much.  And boy, am I glad we ordered it.  The skate was completely deboned and cooked to perfection.  My husband inhaled it so quickly.  He didn't like the fennel salad that came with this.  I could understand b/c the anise flavor of the fennel didn't pair well with skate.  Maybe something more vinegary/tart would've been better.  Licorice and fish just doesn't mesh perfectly.  And the skate could've been seasoned just a touch more.  But this is splitting hairs, b/c the dish was quite stellar.  9/10\n\nI don't usually care much about restaurant ambience/location, but here, it is key.  We somehow got seated front and center to an incredible view of the Bellagio fountains.  It was mind-blowingly incredible!  I think we had the best seat in the house.  We were barely placed inside, at the midpoint of the patio.  If we had been placed on the patio, we would've been to close to the traffic or too exposed.  There was a lamp blocking our otherwise perfect view, but we really didn't think too much about it.  \n\nService was perfunctory, and I can't complain.  I would be very interested to return and try the steak (just need to come hungry enough).  I'm curious about the chicken, too.  Ina Garten makes such a big deal about french chicken that I'm curious what that is about.  Maybe the trout almondine too since I've never ordered it.  Did I mention the onion soup.  Gah, I'm such a little pig!","review_id":"fq1pg1I48e3YFwNUItZXhw","stars":5,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"vH8UjE__eQzUUdDRu0fUMw","date":"2016-09-26"},{"cool":0,"text":"This is my second time here and I have not visited in awhile!

For the month of March, we wanted to do it big.  We wanted to experience something out of the norm, somewhere that required a dress up opportunity. There were a few options, however, we all ended up deciding on Mon Ami Gabi for our \"Fancy Dinner\" event. Boy were we excited!\n\nWhen you enter the restaurant, you immediately hit the bar area. Along with the hostess stand, you see a bunch of high top tables and bar seating. The place just exudes a romantic vibe! It's located directly under the Vegas version Eiffel Tower and along the strip sidewalk. The lights in the location are dim and intimate, the white table clothes bring the upscale element. Wine glasses on the table sparkled brightly. Man, we were excited! Our table top was on the south end of the restaurant and the corner windows viewed the sidewalk veranda and the tower base. Our server, although I can't remember her name, was super sweet! She was personable and offered some really great appetizers and drinks. What I really liked about her was her efficiency! We had a 13 person party and she was still on it! Our food came out hot and ready in record time! For our apps, drinks and meals, here's what we had:\n\nChateau Laronde Desormes Bordeaux for $54 a bottle - This wine was on point! It was soft with a sweet finish. Definitely an everyday kind of Bordeaux, something you can drink all the time. This wine went great with my meal!\n\nWarm Brie Cheese for $12.95 - Served with black pepper honey, garlic, hazelnuts, croutons and greens. I love brie. This combination was no different. Whole cloves of roasted garlic enhanced the flavor of the cheese very well. \n\nChicken Liver Mousse Pate for $11.95 - First time trying this.  THE BEST THING I HAD THAT NIGHT! Served with burgundy red wine mustard and toast brioche with a garnish of gherkins and olives. The burgundy mustard brought a spicy/tangy element and the mouse was so rich and divine. This is MUST TRY, so delicious!\n\nBaked Goat Cheese for $11.95 - Another great dish. Tomato sauce surrounded the cheese with herb garlic bread. The cheese was super creamy and went well with the tomato profile. \n\nSeafood Platter for $49.95 - What a platter! Stuffed with shrimp, oysters and lobsters, this dish offered a little bit of everything for everyone! There were various dipping sauces and it was all served over ice. \n\nBone in Ribeye for $39.95 - This was my actual dinner. 22oz cut of steak, PERFECTLY cooked to my temperature, served with a bearnaise sauce and their signature hand cut fries. The steak was delicious. The right amount of marbleized meat, perfectly seasoned and packed with flavor and juices. AH-MAZE-ING. The bearnaise sauce was definitely not needed but offered another element. The fries were flat and super crispy. Really helped to break up the meat with a crunchy aspect. \n\nWhat a meal! This place has got to be one of the best upscale restaurants I've tried here in Vegas. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an amazing date night restaurant, team building dinner joint or event a place that serves THE BEST pate! I will for sure be back, time and time again.  Thank you so much, Mon Ami Gabi, for making this evening one that I'll never forget!","review_id":"BxRlE_IRn_l86rAmgJlrYQ","stars":5,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":1,"useful":1,"user_id":"CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw","date":"2014-04-21"},{"cool":0,"text":"(edited on 11/17/12)\n\nI have been there about 7 times. I like to sit outside - to watch Bellagio fountain show. \n\nFood quality wise, you can't compare to Robuchon or Bouchon - Mon Ami Gabi is a French version of Denny's. That's for sure. Or maybe worse... \n\nI've had Ground Ahi Tuna Burger and Bacon Cheese Burger - nothing special, nothing better than burgers at Hard Rock Cafe.\n\nI've had seafood crepe - it is OK. Seafood is not fresh. Could be using frozen seafood.\n\nGratin - greasy - heavy - rich - if you like to gain fat, this should be fine. I am worried if someone get heart attack. \n\nTrout - i remembered it was no good. \n\nFish and Chips - very thin sliced fish make it pretty greasy. Kinda same as one at Todd English at Aria. (it was my fault to get fish&chips at French bistro, yo know)\n\n(newly edited) \n\nI USED to like all their mousse and pate - along with oysters to pair with wine - with a great fountain view. However, I went back and it was a huge disappointment.\n\nJumbo Shrimp Cocktail - when the server put the dish on our table, something was wrong - shrimps looked kinda brown - we thought it was some sort of spices,,, then as soon as we ate it, we realized that it was an unfresh, oxidized shrimp! It tasted like dirt. Horrible! I'm sure they use the same old shrimps for other dishes. Gross!\n\nLiver Mousse and Pate - I guess no one orders these items here - I could tell because all the edges were all dried out - pretty disgusting. \n\nEndive salad - It is not a great experience to have green leaves turn brown and wilt. \n\nMussels - bad,,,,, They didn't break my expectation. NOT FRESH! At this point, I was concerned about food poisoning. So, I asked to get a check. It was enough...\n\nWhen the food, especially seafood, gets old, they should throw them away - because you know, there is a risk of spreading food poisoning! Don't give me these stained shrimps, dude.\n\nBtw, frites are better than Lay's potato chips. Complimentary Baguette is pretty terrible. You can get better baguettes cheaper at Albertson's.\n\nMy suggestion - never get seafood here if you know what decent seafood tastes like. Just get burgers - cheap and simple. I guess those people who are giving 5 stars just eat burgers and steaks, not seafood. \n\nService - not that great - too busy all the time - my server wasn't nice at all - she didn't stop at our table. No refills. I saw she was chatting for a while at another table, tho. \n\nYou will see all the men in black here - they indeed look professional in a funny way - but imagine if they change it to Denny's uniforms - surly enough, they would fit really well.\n\nAlso, when I made a reservation today (Sat. Nov 10 2012 around lunch time), the hostess was really rude over the phone.  This is Karma on Yelp, haha.\n\nI have been going there to see Bellagio, not to enjoy food and service, but it was way too terrible.... I will never go back again.\n\n1 star is for Bellagio's fountain show.","review_id":"nlDliJhXg4InUlM4XRulgA","stars":1,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":2,"useful":1,"user_id":"LwtKrQPMN78mkSIozJK3Lg","date":"2012-11-17"},{"cool":1,"text":"Wait for a table on the patio.

The only thing on this appetizer that wasn't amazing was the seaweed salad.  Worth the $24.95 a person price tag.  Also had the Steak Roquefort served with these crispy potatoes.  Very flavorful, but you better love Roquefort cheese or this dish is not for you.  \n\nHonestly, the food is beside the point at Mon Ami Gabi.

We initially rejected MAG's $99 prix fixe deal but then went crawling back after calling place after place, demanding upwards of $1,000 PER PERSON.\n\nMon Ami Gabi rewarded our patronage with front-row seats to the Bellagio fountain show under comfortable heaters (keep in mind this was winter time!) on the patio.  The food was seriously plentiful and delicious.  I will never forget the escargot - it was simply to die for.\n\nOur most recent visit was last month.  Yes, our table was not in the ideal location (in the bar area) and we were seated next to a table of ignorant early 20's, probably having a first meal in a French restaurant (one guy told our waiter the French onion soup wasn't what he expected.

Because they do it real and delicious here.)\n\nMust haves: Baked cheese...downside - they don't give you nearly enough bread; scallop entree - you get FIVE large sea scallops (which is 2 more than most other places) which were perfectly seasoned and cooked and of course, their steak....I asked for the bearnaise sauce with my ribeye but in the end, hardly used any of it.  My steak was perfectly cooked and the leftover half of it tasted just as good (though a bit cooler) later that night.\n\nService was...interesting.  Very attentive but maybe a little smarmy.  Our waiter was French.  How original...a French server (with a French name) in a French restaurant.  Our table took bets on whether his accent was real or not.

A complimentary crusty, warm, soft French baguette was also served.  \n\nThis place is a must for whenever you brunch in Vegas. The view of the Bellagio Fountains is a nice backdrop.  Although our reservation was for the Main Dining Room (they don't take reservations for the patio area), there were plenty of tables available on a weekday, so we were given the option of which area we would like to sit in.

We immediately ask if we could sit outside, and the hostess is quick to tell us there is no shade whatsoever if we choose to sit out there.  (Hmm...it's like over a hundred degrees today!)  So, we decide to sit inside, but as we are headed out, I notice a handful of people sitting in the blazing heat and we decide to go for it.  Smack dab in the middle of the patio and perfect for people-watching!\n\nIt's a quick peek at the menu and we're set to go!  Waters arrive shortly, along with warm French baguettes and butter.  The bread and butter is SO good, and just so French!  Yum!\n\nOur food soon arrives:\n* Mussels Mariniere with frites ($21.95 full order) - Loaded with tons of onions, we start digging in.  One of my favorite things about eating mussels is the yummy sauce that comes with it, perfect for dipping warm French bread into!  What I don't like is finding the beard still attached to the mussel.  Sure, I can let one go.  But there were at least four mussels were I was spitting the beard out.  Yuck.  The frites are usually one of my favorite parts too, but I wasn't digging their version here.  It's more like deep-fried potato sticks\n\n  * County Style Pate \"cornichons, whole grain mustard, country toast\" ($9.95) - The pate was just okay, nothing spectacular.  You take a piece of pate and put it on the country bread, and take a bite.  Have a cornichon too while you're at it.  But it wasn't something that transported me back to the French countryside.\n\nOur waiter also forgot The Husband's Kronenbourg, which required a bit of reminding.\n\nService was good in the beginning with our water glass being filled often and more baguettes coming our way.  Then I think there was a shift change because all of sudden we were forgotten about and we had to wave the staff down for more water and our check.  We also noticed that we didn't get any kind of dipping sauce for our frites, but noticed other tables automatically got ketchup.  I would have been happy with mayo!\n\nOverall, I guess I was expecting more - from the service and the food.  Everyone raves about this place, and I was left feeling underwhelmed.  The location is perfect, and if you sit outside, it's fabulous for people watching and the Bellagio water fountain show.  Perhaps I'll go again and further explore their menu.","review_id":"O-j2w_6b3X1l-O5L6wJ1Qg","stars":3,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":9,"user_id":"rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw","date":"2009-07-30"},{"cool":0,"text":"Went for lunch today... 110 degrees outside.... so decided to sit in the conservatory instead of directly on the patio.

We were seated in an area that was kind of outside, but also inside (because they had all the glass windows open to the outside dining area). I was quite pleased with out seating because it afforded us a view of the outside, but kept us from the literal \"street-view\" of the Strip. \n\nOur server was a congenial lovely woman who definetely has a knack for serving and making her guests feel at ease. Throughout the entire meal she refilled coffees, brought Diet Pepsis out without us having to ask, and truly made an effort to romanticize our lovely French dining experience.\n\nWe started our meal with the Escargot, which were swimming in a potent pesto and garlic sauce. The snails' texture was spot-on, not chewy, simply a good mouth-feel, and the garlic, while very prevalent, added to the escargot, it did not distract.\n\nMy Onion Soup was served with the appetizer and I was fairly happy with the soup. I thought though it had a bit too much of a sweet taste for my liking. The crouton and cheese ratio was a bit off, with there being a just a *tad* too much cheese. I almost felt bad leaving some of it in my cup, but I had really had enough of it as I got toward the end of the cup.\n\nAs for my main dish I stuck with a classic - Quiche Lorraine. The flavors were mixed well - not too much of any ingredient, and the crust was classic - flaky, but not too crunchy or over-baked. Perfect for a quiche. The quiche around the outside was a bit dry, but as you moved inward it became a much better mix of eggs and cheese. \n\nI ended with the Chocolate Mousse - a refreshingly light dessert, yet it is chocolate so it has that little bit of decadence you want with a dessert. It has little crunchy Kit-Kat like chocolate balls on top of it and is served with some amazing whipped cream on the side. I also sampled my friend's chocolate tart and believe me, that dessert is absolutely worth every penny. I sampled the Bananas Foster from my other friend's plate that too was absolutely delicious.\n\nOverall I must say Mon Ami had good food with just a few minor flaws, but the pristine service made up for it. 5 Stars indeed.","review_id":"W7Hg9ckX5e8L_ihXdEg4qA","stars":5,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":1,"useful":4,"user_id":"hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ","date":"2013-07-24"},{"cool":0,"text":"My boyfriend and I came here one morning because it is one of the few breakfast places that looked appealing to us. \nThis review is going to be short because there's not much to say.\nFirstly, the only entrance is from the inside of the hotel, even though there is outdoor dining and it is facing the strip.

Indoors/Outdoors.  They have dark indoors, a big glass room semi-indoors, and an outside patio.\n\n2.  In a great spot.  (Under the Eiffel Tower, across from the Bellagio Fountains.)\n\n3.  A broad menu.  (Despite being a 'French' restaurant, it's been Americanized enough for any visitor to find something tasty on the menu.)\n\n4.  Prices are strip reasonable.  Meaning you're not being r-ped, which more and more is a disturbing trend on the strip.  \n\nSIDEBAR\n\nI get it that some restaurants want to be exclusive and riff-raff free.  That a dashing man and his fabulous babe want to be dressed to the nines... nowhere near the overweight shorts and wifebeater clan clasping four foot tall plastic Eiffel Tower Diabetes Cocktails.   So if such places want to charge $60 a pound for fish (Hello MILOS) you're welcome to do so.\n\nHowever, too much of the strip is joining in this bank account draining pricing scheme.  Places that are inside dim strip hotels, with no view, inconvenient from the street, with limited menus.  If this trend doesn't stop soon... it'll be cheaper to gamble for your dinner at a roulette table.  Seriously --\n\n-- may I speak on behalf of all Yelpsters and say WE DON'T GIVE A CREPE IF TABLE GAMBLING IS DOWN IN VEGAS and that can't be used as an excuse to serve $25 hamburgers.   Vegas is supposed to be fun... not a grapefruit enema.\n\nEND SIDEBAR\n\nAnyway -- MON AMI GABI still gets that.  The service -- although not really French -- is quite good and the restaurant is more than accommodating.  They did something for us on late afternoon that no restaurant has ever done for me.  I don't want to say it out loud or it might ruin it, but let's say it's akin to offering a Happy Hour hours before the actual Happy Hour starts.  NO ONE DOES STUFF LIKE THIS... but Mon Ami Gabi did.  With zero complaint.  They warned us our food might take a bit longer... but it wasn't any longer than any Vegas lunch.\n\nIf you want a really romantic meal, this isn't the kind of place to do it unless you get a table on the street and you LOVE noise and crowds.  However, if you like a fun place that takes you out of Vegas while somehow being in the center of it -- give MON AMI GABI a try.","review_id":"6qRAJgJiA3ISXCQKn5fXCg","stars":5,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":8,"useful":3,"user_id":"h-brvh9UKmAOKb0Q-VZpgg","date":"2014-04-25"},{"cool":0,"text":"Favorite dishes: escargot, seafood crepe, mussels, salmon salad, and crab cakes.\nI always come here whenever I go to Vegas just to eat their escargots.

It was nicely sweet with all of the fruit bits soaking in it but still strong enough. I just wish it was a bit cheaper.\n\nFrench Onion Soup - This was the standout of the meal. It had plenty of onion flavor and a huge helping of Gruyere cheese! I actually really loved this and another bonus is that it's huge. It definitely feeds two people, no problem. \n\nSteak Bearnaise - The steak was chewy to the point that both the bf and I had to spit out a couple of pieces. The Bearnaise was actually cold, and from my understanding, it is supposed to be served room temperature. It wasn't very flavorful either. The frites that came with them were unexpectedly thin, but quite good. They reminded me of those little fried potato matchsticks you can buy in a tin from supermarkets. Ahh childhood nostalgia.  \n\nSea Scallops (entree) - I had actually ordered the appetizer version, with caramelized fennel and onion marmalade, but they mixed up my order and out came the entree with butternut squash puree and brussels sprouts. The scallops were cooked very well but everything else on the plate was not great. Perhaps this is because I'm not a fan of brussels sprouts. Also, the butternut squash puree was light and not an overpowering flavor, but again, didn't enjoy it so much.\n\nThe staff here was wonderful and thankfully they didn't charge me extra for the mix up.

We timed it well because many behind us were told 1 1/2 hrs. Our waiter was pleasant and patient with us, although there were times we wondered where he'd run off too because he kept disappearing. They brought out a warm baguette and some sort of bean salad as a starter, both were light and tasty while we looked over the menu. The bf wanted some Escargot, which I had never tried, I wasn't excited about it but told him I'd share it if he wanted it. It was better than I expected, tasted mostly like pesto. It was about as yummy as I think a person could make snails taste.\n\nI was leery about ordering a steak because I didn't want to be let down so in the end I ordered the Gabi's Fish & Frits but substituted the Frits for Grilled Asparagus. The bf ordered the Filet Mignon Merlot and also substituted the Frits but for the Sauteed Mushrooms.

The food, service and drinks are just amazing.  This is one of the best thinly pounded steaks you can get anywhere.

I don't remember it being too great, but I thought I would give it another try last week.  I was traveling in Vegas for work, and having dinner solo that evening.  I went in around 8:30pm and sat at the bar.  The first thing I noticed was the numerous servers standing around, and just chatting with each other.  They were definitely overstaffed.\n\nI got the bartenders attention, and ordered a glass of Bordeaux.  I was bothered that she served it to me in a small white wine glass.  I noticed that other patrons were served in Bordeaux glasses, but she elected to just quickly give it to me.  She even opened a new bottle, and did no offer me a taste.\n\nThis was basically how the entire meal went for me.  I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt, and she definitely gave the attention to an older gentleman wearing a suit at the end of the bar. I usually don't weigh service as an issue at restaurants, but I do take offense when I am ignored for wearing a t-shirt, or if nobody says goodbye to me when i leave.  I definitely had an experience with both of these at the restaurant.\n\nTo eatm I had the filet and a side salad.  Both were mediocre, and nothing fantastic.  If I was rating the food alone, this would be a 3 star dinner.  However, the service clearly makes me drop Mon Ami down by at least a star.  In my opinion, for the price, 2 stars is very generous.

They have quite a few steak options all ranging from the least expensive hanger steak to filets. The steak was cooked perfectly, but I don't think it separates them from any other restaurant in the area. The service was excellent, which is to be expected with the caliber of this place. I'd absolutely go back and try different menu options to get a better idea of the food quality and to try and grab a table outside. If you're enticed by the outdoor dining option, give it a go. If you don't feel like waiting over an hour to watch the fountain show and people watch, but still want quality French food, head over to Comme Ca at The Cosmopolitan. They have outdoor seating and the food is competitively priced.","review_id":"JJQ0T5kvGG8ld-m-ZZr0_A","stars":4,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"Yvj5Hws7hkHriZZuxsjQcg","date":"2013-11-27"},{"cool":2,"text":"I felt like I was transported to a cozy, intimate cafe in France.

Hands down this is one of my favorite places to dine when I am in town, and I can honestly say I have never been disappointed. This classic French bistro serves magnificent food in a wonderful atmosphere, and at a fair price. Thier position on the strip also offers a terrific view of the Bellagio.\n\nAs soon as I boarded my flight from NY this morning my mouth was drooling with anticipation. Thier steak frites are absolutely amazing, and will melt in your mouth with orgasmic bliss. I knew that I would be dining alone tonight, so I did not even make a reservation as the bar area is a great spot to eat here, especially the one out facing the strip with a view of the Bellagio water show. I just winged it and ended up with a prime spot sitting and conversing with other single visitors in town enjoying a meal at the bar.\n\nI ordered  a glass of Pinot Noir, and chose the Steak Frites Bordelaise. Tender steak sliced thin, almost like a flank steak, with carmelized onions, and a red wine sauce ladeled over the top. Crispy and thin frites with just the right amount of saltiness accompanied the steak. I bit into the first bite and - OH -MY-GOD - I wanted to melt off my bar stool right then and there. The exquisite taste of the steak along with the carmelized onions just put a smile on my face the whole time I was there. I think everyone around me had the same look of satisfaction from what they were eating too. I went absolutely all piggy and finished every bite of steak and frites on the plate. I even soaked up the extra sauce on the plate with this amazing hot mini baguette of crispy bread they serve with the meal.\n\nIt was all so good I totally ignored the booming sounds of the water show going on across the street. As I settled up the bill I was glowing in the aftermath of total satisfaction. Just a perfect place to have a great meal in a civilized atmosphere wether it be a date or a group. As I walked down the street back towards my casino hotel I felt as if I was floating two inches above the ground.

The other 4 were already there (coming from the Venetian) and I was on foot coming way down from the Luxor. Needless to say, I was holding up the crowd. The rest of the party could not be seated or put their name on the list until I arrived as well. When I finally did arrive, we were seated outside on the patio - which was a plus. Nice weather, good views - but the table was very small. Too small to crowd 5 people around. Inevitably, there was frequent bumping from people walking by on their way to and from their tables. \n\nI thought the service was a bit lower than expected. One guy came out to give everyone water. He filled up everyone's glass and when it came to mine there was only enough for 1/3 of a glass. Did he get more? No. So I drank it thinking it would be a sign to bring more - but it wasn't. We did receive two sleeves of baguettes. One saucer was filled with the olive oil for dinner and there were four other saucers for people to put their bread - except there were five of us. I had to eventually stop someone and ask for a plate. \n\nLooking over the menu I selected the Caesar salad. When everyone's plate was brought out everything looked so good. Another guy at our table ordered another kind of salad and it was huge - then mine came out. It was one of the smallest, most boring things I have seen ever: a few strips of lettuce, some cheese and a shard of bread - all for the nice price of $9. \n\nI could definitely do without a repeat visit here.","review_id":"sDziPWvDeAMdqv_MDHCIRg","stars":2,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"3xORNxbKdd08LUf0tclx3A","date":"2010-12-06"},{"cool":0,"text":"Love the salmon entree great steaks too !

Mon Ami Gabi is located inside the Paris Resort and Casino. \n\nWe were seated by the edge of the patio with view to the Bellagio fountain. Our waitress came over and introduced herself. She also gave us a few recommendations being that it was our first time and specials that were not on the menu.

I noticed that it said it was served with blueberries and warm blueberry syrup, topped with whipped cream.. well I was a bit scared. I am not a fan of blueberries being that I was always fooled as a child (blueberry pancakes are NOT the same as chocolate chips, mom!) I decided to go for it and face my fears especially since I knew already that it was going to be full of blueberries. Lemme tell you this, it was the most perfect french toast ever that I have had in a very long time. The sweetness was done to perfection, the blueberries themselves were perfect, everything about this meal was just magical and out of this world. The french toast was cooked just right. It makes me want to cry of happiness. I could eat this all day, errday and be a happy person forever! I would HIGHLY recommend this dish.

But I felt strongly enough about my last visit to waste some time venting here. \n\n7:30am on a brisk Saturday morning, I found myself crossing town on the way home from a night of a carousing. As I've been known to do on such nights, I decided it would be a fine time to indulge in a nice breakfast. Being that the weather was particularly tolerable for February, I decided to bask in it & dine on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi. I've enjoyed my similar visits in the past. Sure, the food isn't as good as Bouchon, but while it's not cheap, it's not quite as expensive, and the smoking-friendly patio has been enough to make up for any culinary shortcomings. So what happens when you disturb that equation? As it turns out, those pluses aren't strong enough to carry the place.\n\nThere were two things in particular that chapped my ass. Firstly, there was the construction team out working or surveying or whatever on the patio. I got there pretty close to opening, and hey, the works gotta get done sometime. But the incessant pacing back & forth, discussion, and ladder-arranging turned out to be disturbing enough to aggravate my otherwise saintly patience. Being that I'm such a nice guy, by the time I'd had enough the place started filling up, so the construction team was forced out by necessity, so I never had to speak up. I was distracted enough by everything that I didn't notice how filthy my water glass was. I'm not the kind of guy to bitch about things like that, but it was bad enough that I didn't feel out of place for asking for another glass. I explained what happened to the waiter, and he quickly replaced my glass. I continued on with my meal, and as I was done I picked up my water to find that the new one was just as bad as the first. Now, you would think that when someone - right or wrong - brings up a complaint like that the staff would spend the extra 30 seconds it would take to find the shiniest glass in the rack. Not at Mon Ami Gabi! By this point I was done eating, so I decided to just mention it to the waitress when she asked how everything was. Well, that opportunity never presented itself (which is a problem unto itself in my opinion). \n\nAm I nitpicking? Maybe. But Mon Ami Gabi is by no means cheap, and their food is not so spectacular that it makes up for everything else. And sure, breakfast is considered a \"lesser\" meal at places like this, but that doesn't mean they get a pass on anything that happens before noon. A year ago this would've given them a 4 star review.

All the components were things I liked (who doesn't like black truffles?) they just didn't seem to jive like the gnocchi dishes I'm used to. I like a cheesy cream sauce to compliment a good gnocchi and this dish had neither a harmonious creamy sauce nor a good gnocchi.

Mon Ami is located right at the strip and at the bottom of the Paris hotel.  There is patio seating, so if you are lucky, you get to people watch (my faveeee!!) as you eat :)\n\n**TIP: If you do decide on patio seating, make sure you get there early so you don't have to wait too long.  \n\nI'm not one to be known for my patience, so both times I've been here, I've opted for the regular dining inside the restaurant.  The restaurant feels a little bit upscale because there are dark woods, tablecloths, wine glasses, but don't let that fool you b/c dishes range about $15-$18, which is not bad considering the quality of food you get.\n\nFOOD QUALITY:\nOkay, most importantly, you want to know about the food right? Let me tell you - it is AMAZING.  If I was trapped in a deserted island and could only bring 3 things with me, I may say their Skinny Pancakes as one of my 3 things.  It was offered as a special when I went the last time I dined here and I am so glad I ordered it!  The pancake was as thin as a crepe and drizzled with this nice glaze, topped with glazed pears.  What I loved was that the edges of the pancake, which were not yet touched by the glaze was still crispy, so it was a wonderful mixture of texture and flavors with every bite!\n\nI also LOVE that the bread comes out warrrrmmm!!! Mmm mmm!  My thighs now hate me because of my love/hate relationship with warm bread and butter, but it is SO GOOD (sorry thighs).\n\nI also got the Strawberry Waffle as well here and it was equally as delicious!  The strawberries were sweet and juicy and the pancakes were cooked to crispy delectable perfection.  Don't even get me started with that maple syrup.  I was trying to find other things I could dip into that maple syrup just so I could have more.\n\n**TIP:  They also have a Blood Mary Bar in the middle of the restaurant. I believe it was about $11-$12.  It loved amaze-balls!  I will definitely be back to try it out the next time.\n\nSERVICE:\nService was great!  The main thing I need in the morning is COFFEE!  Don't even try getting a coherent answer from me until I've had at least 2-3 cups.  Our waitress kept my coffee refilled at all times.

Perfect plan I tell you, about 830 straight to a table street side. A little disappointed in the lack of Crepes on the menu as they had only Deseret Crepes. However my server explained that \"thin pancakes\" are really big crepes.\n\nI opted for the lemon and fruit \"thin pancakes\", with a double shot espresso and a fruit cup on the side. \n\nEspresso - Wow, I was super disappointed as I was imagining myself sitting in Paris sipping espresso in a cafe. This espresso was really bad. It was made perfectly (texture and color) but was bitter and just a bad roast. Now I am sort of a espresso snob coming from Seattle however I don't feel that having high expectations for espresso in a French Cafe is too much to ask. I expected an artisan roast and something very smooth, wrong.\n\nNow the thin pancakes were excellent. I was very happy with the flavor but the sheer size literally made me think this is so not French. It was massive and wasteful when it came to pure size of the pancakes themselves, however it was pretty stingy on the fruit topping (possibly 3 strawberries slices up). The flavor was very good and would have seemed somehow even better, if it were in short supply making me savor each bite. However with this huge portion it I ate until I was very full and still sent back half a plate of food. \n\nOverall a good experience but if you are a French Bistro in a French themed hotel; they might want to send the manager to France, Paris in particular, to see how the french really eat and live. It seems like a French Claim Jumpers or something when it came to portions, and a  jip of a coffee pastry place. I think they need to focus a little more on trying to serve great food and minimize the portions to a reasonable level and stop trying to be everything to everyone. I imagine accommodating the fanny pack crowd is a challenge as you have to to make ends meet on the strip however, most fanny packers are not ordering the thin pancakes and espresso. Do the IHOP thing on the American items but make some crafted products for people who are real foodies. You don't have to totally sell out to make the dollar.\n\nAs far as price, I was a little surprised considering the $25.00 bill with $5 tip. $30 for crepes and espresso? I think the espresso was $7 which actually made it even worse than the taste. I might go again, but I might not. Probably better places to fit my cravings when I get them.","review_id":"3EtFMkGhhYt41jifrnd1IA","stars":3,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"_i3IZYU28R3xgV4hxkmKjw","date":"2012-03-19"},{"cool":14,"text":"Welcome to Disney Land!

It's usually less than the wait time they tell you though.  It's worth it to sit outside as you can see the Fountains at Bellagio go off and watch the action on the Strip.

The broth has a sweetness to it and there is the perfect blend of caramelized onions, croutons, and cheese to make it the best onion soup I've ever tried.

The patty was thick, and Sumana and Wayne's was cooked perfectly medium rare, but the other burger was more toward medium. There was a good amount of seasoning on the patty and there was a clear meat flavor. The brie worked well in the burger; it was subtle and complemented the patty (said everyone else). I, personally, am not a huge fan of brie so I wasn't as big a fan. The bun was able to soak up juices without falling apart and was gooey and a little bit sweet. The bacon was nice and crispy, chewy, and peppery. This burger was a little difficult to eat because the lettuce was placed on top of the patty so the top bun kept sliding off the lettuce. \n\nIII. The fries\nThe fries were shaped funny, and were not uniformly cut. This meant that some fries were thinner and crispier while others had more potatoey goodness. Overall, these fries are sliced pretty thin and are probably double fried. They were nicely salted. \n\nIV. Miscellaneous\nThis place is located in the front of the Paris hotel. It's very popular for brunch so make reservations! There was a gigantic line to get in when we left. The restaurant is a little dark inside, which gives a more upscale feel. There is also an outside patio, which is nice on a nice day. We were there during breakfast hours (until 11am) and the burger was on that menu but it didn't specify the type of cheese used on the burger. It is also on the brunch menu, which specifies the type of cheese. Our server was named Brooke and she was great. She accidentally dropped a glass at our table, but was really apologetic. No harm, no foul. No bathrooms in the actual restaurant. It's in the casino; turn left when exiting the restaurant. Lastly, parking here is confusing. We parked at Paris and it was really hard to find our way out to the strip. \n\nV. Value\nThere was a little bit of debate here regarding the value. Some thought it was on the expensive side, but others thought that the quality of ingredients justified the high price tag.\n\nVI. The verdict\nGreat meaty burger! The ratings: 3.8, 4.1, 4.5, 4.6, 4.6.\n\nNext burger crew meeting: Fat Choy right after we finish at Mon Ami! Burger burger burger burger burger!","review_id":"CTzgU2VN0VC08BHdxKqqcg","stars":4,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":1,"useful":0,"user_id":"BoRDC7m0JP1pm1OapkDG7A","date":"2016-05-22"},{"cool":2,"text":"I still can't pronounce the name of this place.\nLocated in Paris hotel casino, this place is right near the entrance facing Las Vegas blvd.\nA friend decided on this place because of the yelp ratings.\nWe came in with about 15-20 people around 4:30PM on a hot Saturday afternoon in the middle of July.\nWe were seated right away, service was great!\nGlass was never empty and the servers were always around.\nHowever, the food took a while, but this was a big group.\n\nThe fresh baguette was delicious!!

Heh, jokes on me now. I def didn't take French class back in school. Anyways, went here for a birthday celebration. \n\nFresh baked free bread- 3 star. It was good, but I've had better. Why couldn't they make this better considering that it's a French resto?\n\nBone-in rib-eye- 5 star. It was a tad tad tad bit overly seasoned (with salt) but it was cooked to perfection, with charring on the outside. I had mine medium rare, and it was delicious. The fries (think french fry chips) were okay. I wish they'd stick with regular pomme frites. The burnaise sauce was SOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOD. Dip that meat in the sauce and it's a game changer! \n\nCaramelized scallops with pumpkin puree and brussel sprouts- 4 star. The scallops were OK. It was delicious, but scallops are scallops no matter where you go I guess, as long as it's cooked correctly. The standout is the BRUSSEL SPROUTS that were included. This is what brought the dish up from a 2 to a 4 star. \nThey were the BEST Brussel Sprouts I have EVER had in my life. It was charred on the edges, and just enough crunch to make this pungent veggie go from nasty to \nfantabulous. You can order these as a side. \n\nMussels Mariniere (white wine and herbs) - 3 stars. I wish there was a bit more lemon or garlic flavor in the sauce. It was OK for me. I couldn't even taste the saffron (or maybe it wasn't even in it?) \n\nMacaroni Gratin- 3 star. This was good, but a very tiny portion as a side for $7.95. It wasn't spectacular or memorable, and I'd skip this next time. Plus, it's carby...I just did you a huge favor. \n\nFree dessert for my bday- some Eclair with ice cream.

Friends got some burgers that filled them up. I got an onion soup that was nice but nothing mind-blowing. The stand-out item was the homemade bread. NOW THAT! Was awesome.

There's also a half-way outdoor patio seating you might opt for that puts you outside but not completely on the Strip.\n\nSo why minus one star?

The patio area seems to be the place where people want to sit, as it was almost at capacity but almost empty inside.  We chose to sit inside.  It had been a while since I'd dined here and never for brunch.  I was not disappointed.\n\nI had the best Croque Madame ($14) ever!  The bread was just so buttery with a light crunch.  The sandwich was so simple yet made really well.  The ham, which I find on the saltier side, was not salty at all!   And the egg on top (over easy) was cooked perfectly.  I definitely recommend this if you are a fan of this sandwich.  In addition, it came with their fries that I love so much.  They look like flat wonton chips and come crispy.\n\nMy friend ordered the special that morning, which was a Duck Hash.  Unfortunately, it was not as good as my sandwich.  The dish was way too salty, though certain bites seemed okay.  The bites that were not salty did taste good, so it was a shame that the salt was so overpowering in most of it.  It had a nice blend of herbs and came with homemade English muffins, which were definitely better than the store-bought kind.  I had the fresh orange juice, which tasted like it was not freshly squeezed but store bought.  I've notice many restaurants will call their OJ freshly squeezed when it comes from a carton that says \"freshly squeezed.\"  This does not count!  Not sure if Mon Ami does that, but it didn't taste fresh.  \n\nService was good, and I'd definitely order the Croque Madame again!

Appetizers included Escargot - it came in a DELICIOUS garlicy sauce perfect for dipping the bread in. Could probably make this a meal with the bread and AMAZING sauce! I tried one of the snails too and it really doesn't taste like anything. But DAAAAAMN, that sauce!!! NOM NOM NOM! \nI had a Caesar salad and it was nothing to rant and rave about. When it hit the table I was actually rather disappointed with the presentation and how PLAIN it looked. The French Onion soup wasn't too bad, the usual saltiness and nice and cheesy.\nFor my entree I of course had to order the Scallops! I was actually NOT impressed with the scallops at all. I ate two of them and had the rest boxed up. Normally no matter how full I am, I would DEVOUR my scallops. They were just so-so. Not as tender, buttery, awesomely-delicious as ones I've had in the past. \nFriend ordered the special, Bacon wrapped filet medallions with fingerling potatoes. I like bacon, but I really don't care for bacon wrapped foods. I tried a piece with the bacon on it and wasn't really impressed. Then I tried a piece without the bacon and it tasted a lot better to me. \nFor dessert we ordered the Chocolate Mousse which was OKAY. It came with these little chocolate crunchy balls on top that I didn't care for too much, but the Mousse itself wasn't bad. \nThere was also White Chocolate Bread Pudding which was GOOD! I've had bread pudding before and never really liked it but this one was actually DELISH. \nI believe my dessert was THE best one out of the three: the Banana's Foster Crepe!

I used to laughingly refer to Mon Ami as the Olive Garden of French restaurants, homogenized versions of French bistro classics. But as I grow older and (hopefully) wiser Ive found that this isn't really the case. Yes this is a chain but they do try to do their best with what they do. I re-read my previous review (2008) and wow did I just sound like an arrogant dick. I apologize for that and sure I could delete it but think its much better left to show a contrast of me growing up. \n\nNow with all that being said, I have to say that I always crave their ribeye steak slathered in deliciously sweet bordelaise sauce when we visit. This is Vegas and there are loads of steakhouses pretty much everywhere but for the price point this steak is a great value as well as a great taste! Its slightly fatty, beefy richness is cooked exactly how I love it, medium rare. This IMHO is the only steak on the menu to order. While the lesser priced steaks are alright its only a few bucks more for the ribeye. \n\nIf you haven't tried it, the goat cheese and tomato sauce appetizer is super tasty. Creamy goat cheese melts into the tomato sauce fortifying it with amazing flavor. It comes with a slab of garlic butter soaked bread which is kind of greasy so I opted for hot fresh baguette. The frisée, kale and bacon salad make for an awesome salad that's covered with a single poached egg. You know you can put warmed egg yolks on anything and it'll taste good. The dressing is nicely acid with a slight sweetness that cuts the bacon and egg richness. So good.\n\nWho knows, maybe my supposed standards have gone down or perhaps, just perhaps, good food is just good food no matter where it comes from.

I haven't been able to go to Paris yet, but the Paris Hotel may be the closest I will get to being there for a while, so, I shall enjoy what I have at the moment.\n\nThe very first time I went here was with my girlfriend on date. Often times we like to tour the city as if we've never been here and well, Mon Ami Gabi was already her favorite and she introduced this elegant place on the Las Vegas strip. I would recommend calling ahead for reservations as this place tends to become very busy and crowded. If you're lucky enough, request for the patio and it places you right across the street from the Bellagio fountains. It is a spectacular feat when you're with that special person enjoying a lovely dinner! :)\n\nAs soon as your server greets, you'll be asked for your choice of drink. I'm a water person so, I'll always get water. For you wine and champagne drinkers, ask your server what they would recommend with your meal. The servers are pretty knowledgable of the perfect dinner match. They'll serve with French bread and a carrot salad or slaw. It doesn't come with very much flavor so if you're worried about ruining your palette for what's to come, you needn't worry.  We usually order the steamed mussels in a leek cream.  It changed recently so it isn't as great as it used to be.  The whole serving size isn't the same size as what it used to be, so you won't get as much as before, but still a tasty appetizer.\n\nAnd now for the main course.......\nFilet with red wine reduction and merlot butter cooked to medium :9\"\"\" yum! This is my girlfriend's favorite steak for 1) The flavor of the reduction with the merlot butter, 2) the merlot butter, 3) The way the steak is cooked to perfection so that it melts in your mouth! Mmm... The filet is also served with frites (french fries). I have tried the different steaks like the Steak Roquefort (bleu cheese sauce) and the Steak Bordelaise (red wine). It depends on the flavor you're craving but regardless of which steak you're ordering, your choice will always be a tasty one. I've returned numerous times to enjoy the service, the atmosphere, and most of all the food. I'm already looking forward to the next time while typing this review. So I would definitely return!

It is a thin piece of steak and it's buttery and comes with frites which are very crispy (please don't ask for steak sauce!!!).  Warm Brie cheese - creamy and is perfect with their warm baguette. Croque Monsieur - the presentation is a bit different.  Instead of egg or melted cheese on top, theirs is cheese on top but it's not melted and the whole sandwich itself is lacking creaminess and it comes with frites as well but it's quite alright. \n\nYou can't go to a French restaurant without having chocolate mousse and profiteroles.  The chocolate mousse is semi-sweet so it's bitter and a bit sweet - the perfect chocolate!  It's smooth as silk and melts in your mouth.  You have to trust this chocoholic!

There is a door opened out to the outdoor seating area and the constant chill wind which cools the food very fast was not 'cool'.  \n\nThe Jumbo Lump Crab Cake (celery root remoulade, gribiche sauce) was really average.

I could barely taste the dressing.  \n\nThe Roast Chicken & Frites ( all-natural roasted half chicken, mushrooms, bacon, pearl onions) - oh pleeeaaasssee!  Costco's Rotisserie chicken had more flavor than this.  It was dry and tasteless!\n\nThe Filet Mignon (merlot butter, red wine reduction) which is their signature dish and you would think it should stand out!  First of all, I ordered it medium and it came as medium rare.  The sauce was supposed to be merlot butter but it was so bland that I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to flavor it.

For example, the salad was slightly over $10 and for that price I would've expected a large salad that could actually serve as a meal. Instead, it was more like a side dish.

The host joked around about me being late (which I appreciated), but was able to seat me within five minutes despite the long line at the hostess desk!  The person who escorted us to our table was warm, welcoming, and hilarious to talk to!\n\nWhen making our reservation, we were advised that it would be for inside the restaurant and that outside seating would be first-come, first-serve (about a 90 minute wait at that time). However, we were seated on a deck area that was between the indoor seating and balcony seating. We LOVED this area because we still had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains without the wait (nor the drunks roaming the Strip). \n\nAs for the food, I had the filet mignon merlot, as well as escargot, sautéed mushrooms, and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. The filet was SCRUMPTIOUS!  One of the best filets I've ever had and reasonably priced. It was so tender and flavorful, and I loved the merlot sauce!  It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. Additionally, the frites were delicious (albeit salty), especially when you dipped it in the merlot sauce.  I would not recommend the sautéed mushrooms, and the escargot was just mediocre. I was surprised they did not provide toast or pastry puffs with the escargot, but they did serve complimentary bread so it worked out. \n\nThe service at Mon Ami Gabi was great!  Everyone was extremely friendly and comfortable cracking jokes - which I liked. However, they were also efficient and accurate, which is equally important.  The view of the Bellagio fountains was the cherry on top!  The restaurant was not too noisy, especially compared to Sugar Factory. \n\nIf you are looking for a high-quality restaurant (especially a steakhouse) with a view of the Bellagio fountains, but cannot afford Bellagio's high-end restaurants, Mon Ami Gabi is the perfect place!  I will definitely return!","review_id":"TT3F-9oOlk5oU6H_MT5rVA","stars":5,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":3,"user_id":"VjmDfDsK9iogVNuaGIBMvw","date":"2014-08-22"},{"cool":0,"text":"Great dinner!

I ordered the French Onion Soup, beautifully presented in a tall tureen with melted Gruyere on top, you can taste a hint of dry white wine in it. I also had the Croque Madame which is an open faced grilled ham and cheese sandwich topped with a fried egg over easy... wonderful as you break open the perfectly prepared egg yoke, it oozes out over the sandwich. Delicious, it was served with some curly endive lightly tossed in a vinaigrette and some skinny pommes frites. My wife had the Bene du Jour: an eggs benedict with smoked salmon and asparagus.

Any restaurant can have a bad day or the server can be off his game. But this has been several times in a row for Mon Ami.\nWe got a great table on the patio. A food runner brought water and bread fairly quickly. Our server made an appearance about 10 minutes after we were seated. An appetizer and a sandwich. Not a complicated order. About 40 minutes later, we waved down our server to ask about our appetizer and to get our water refilled. No apology. No excuse. He assured us it would be out soon. Almost an hour passed. Finally, we waved down  the manager. She apologized, refilled our water, and brought out the appetizer. When the food runners came with our sandwiches, they had to auction them off, not knowing who got what. The fries that were suppose to accompany the sandwiches were brought out cold and soggy - not edible. We flagged down the manager again (our server was nowhere in sight). Another apology and promise to make it right. Well after we finished the sandwiches, she brought us properly done fries. Alas, too late to be enjoyed.\nGiving the devil his due, the food was very tasty (even the very tardy fries were really good) and the ambiance is still terrific. But when the service is this bad, no matter how hard the manager tries to make it right, the dining experience is unpleasant.

The meal was excellent as it was the day before, but the service was even better. :) \n\nMy no longer hungover friend came with me to sit at the bar on day three of our trip. Robert was working again, and gave us continual good service. My friend and I tried new entrees at his recommendation that were just as delicious as our favorites.

But the filet mignon was practically to die for. And we asked to substitute our frites for some veggies (asparagus for mine and green beans for him). Extra charge to do that... are you kidding me? At such a nice/fancy restaurant, they could be that petty? Anyway, so if I had the filet mignon, this place would fully deserve its four stars.","review_id":"iyka9Rxz78nSrg0ErkgG7w","stars":4,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"R2247iVcSL6CBUItgheD3w","date":"2015-07-03"},{"cool":3,"text":"This place is huge!!

Even though this place is very big there were still a few people waiting outside for their table & inside was full. Our waitress (don't know her name) was very good & attentive. They serve a warm bread loaf in a bag that is actually really good only problem is it's very messy so you get crumbs all over the table & there is no one coming by wiping up your crumbs like some restaurants have. I got a grilled ham & cheese with a cheese like sauce that I got on the side. Sauce was tasty & the sandwich was OK. One side wasn't grilled & the other side that was, was dried. The french fries were good. Others got the Eggs Benedict that they all liked & one girl got the quiche which she said was good. Our waters were always full.

The steak, however, should be the star of this meal and it just isn't.\n\nThe one time I didn't get steak I got  a scallop entree and this was much better than the steak- the scallops were seared well and came with a nice sauce- if you go I would highly recommend this over the steak. \n\nSome random other items I have had\n\nFrench Onion soup- this is ok but honestly if you are accustomed to french onion soup at a steakhouse you probably won't like it- it is much more subtle than what we have come to expect from the dish in America\n\nEscargots- very good but VERY garlic tasting, hopefully if you are getting this you aren't on a date.\n\nDuck Confit- This was pretty clumsily done and dissapointing\n\nWhipped Cauliflower- this is actually pretty good- esp if you are trying to avoid potatoes for health reasons this is the side for you\n\nMacaroni Gratin- nothing special, best had elsewhere on the strip \n\n\n\nAmbiance- Many people like sitting outside as you get a good view of people walking the strip and the Bellagio fountains so if the weather is amenable I would recommend that.","review_id":"1I2KiX072utcHjlxMYpsxg","stars":2,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":3,"useful":3,"user_id":"s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw","date":"2014-03-12"},{"cool":1,"text":"Why 5 Stars in a touristy bistro?

I honestly don't think I've experienced that at any other restaurant. Very classy.\n\nThe lunch menu has many options, but I had to go with the steak frites, which really seem like the star here. You can order it prepared multiple ways with different sauces. I opted for the blue cheese one. They apparently pound their steaks to get them super tender. You practically don't need a knife. And it was juicy and wonderfully tasty. The fries were excellently prepared as well. It was truly a 5-star meal.\n\nAnd the appetizer and dessert we had were great too.

The menu is simple in size but beautifully exciting in options. I will tell you about my most recent experience. \n\nI went with girlfriends for brunch on a Saturday late morning. We ordered cocktails and coffee. We started with the smoked salmon appetizer. It was absolutely perfect. Served with a bagel and all the toppings you could ask for. For the main courses we ordered the classic eggs benedict, blueberry waffles and croque monsieur. It was my first time having croque and I am disappointed that I had not known about this before. It was so wonderfully decadent. Covered in a bechamel sauce and served with thin slices potato fries on the side. To. Die. For. \n\nThere is no doubt that this restaurant will remain on our list of go to places to eat. It gives a great view of the strip, has a good patio and a great atmosphere.

Few moderate venues put in the effort to maintain themselves. Mon Ami Gabi is different. After about ten years in the same location, the room looks as new (or new-old) as the day it opened. Really! The tile floors are spotless! The paint is fresh. The waitstaff are far from complacent. And the food is delivered hot and correct, starting with the complimentary warm baguette and carrot relish. \n\nModeled after an idealized Parisian bistro--but thankfully not overburdened by the cliché Lautrec prints--MAG is deceptively big (nearly 400 seats) but divided into several different sections--depending on your mood, you can sit in a dark, book-lined bar room, a warmly lit interior, a comfortable but energetic pavilion, or a boisterous Strip-side patio. The menu follows traditional French brasserie food, but goes the extra mile in terms of variety. Thus the menu includes a vegetarian sampler, fish choices including Skate, a good looking short rib, and over 10 different steak frites varieties. My Steak Bordelaise was, well, perfect. Their ribbon-style fries didn't impress though--true French frites, in my experience, are actually very close to McDonald's, believe it or not. The chicken liver pate was a healthy portion. Prices are not shockingly low, but for the Strip, strike a relative value. There's no reason you can't have that romantic dinner here for 100 dollars, instead of spending 300 somewhere else. Consistency is a quality to be praised in any restaurant--in one wth a prime Strip position that could easily coast on its vantage point, it's almost a wonder.","review_id":"FpLD6HUWJvkPUm6975aWhA","stars":4,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"97TjZvvXtVZY91NEPZXZBQ","date":"2010-01-19"},{"cool":0,"text":"Breakfast Review- \n\nAlways busy even on weekdays.

If you use Yelp to get phone numbers, this one is incorrect.  It takes you to Effiel Tower Restaurant.  I did eventually get through and told her I needed to \"change tomorrow's reservation.\" (The reason I changed it for one person is because if your entire party isn't seated, you can't be considered for deck seating.) She told me she couldn't find me anywhere and I was put on hold for a long time, several times.  Finally she said \"I found your reservation under tomorrow.  There must have been an error.\" Me: \"Nope. I wanted it for tomorrow.\" Gah.  So that was figured out.\n\nThen the day of, the girls are running late and ask me to push it back.

Never saw that. Either way, it looked pretty impressive, not going to lie.  The escargot were good.  They came in a pesto-ish sauce.  The seafood platter was all good except for the main event: the lobster.  The lobster was chewy and overcooked.  We thought we would need steak knives.  I don't know what kind of lobster it was called but it had the spongy legs/claws that I didn't really like either.\n\nI still think this place is pretty reasonably priced and a good balance between casual and fancy for Vegas.

Drinking plenty of water and showering I'd worked up quite an appetite and made my way out for another walk south on the strip - this time to Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  Arriving at 7:20am I was greeted by the friendly hostesses at the door and led promptly to a prime seat on the patio where I watched Vegas roll by - the best part about early morning Vegas is that there are only two sorts of people - the early morning joggers and the people just heading home.  I laughed like hell when a guy came up and yelled \"high five - yellow shirt - I love yellow shirts\" with regard to my vintage LA Kings T.  Only in Vegas.\n\nHaving heard much about Mon Ami Gabi's view - truly awesome sitting 4 feet above Las Vegas Boulevard and directly across from the fountains at Bellagio - I must admit I'd heard mixed reviews of the food and went in with tempered expectations.  Greeted by my server and handed a menu I was offered coffee which I graciously accepted.  A decent French Roast with heavy nuttiness the coffee was good, but probably the worst I had during my trip to Vegas...and refills were slow at best despite the restaurant being unfilled throughout my meal.  Browsing the menu I was impressed by both the sweets and the savories - deciding between the Blueberry French Toast and Poached Pear Waffles proved difficult and thus I ended up with neither.   Placing my order I also opted to order a pain au chocolate from the limited bakery menu.\n\nSitting for nearly 30 minutes while I waited for my food I sipped my coffee and watched the street - I've said it before and I'll say it again, half the \"Vegas Experience\" is people watching.  Eventually arriving along with only my first refill of coffee (I had to request it - thankfully after this service improved and a young man took over my coffee refills) I was somewhat surprised when the sweet arrived with my savory breakfast.  Cool and questionably fresh the Pain au Chocolate was appropriately buttery and flakey but lacked any pizzazz.  Featuring a small single vein of average chocolate I could've gotten the same dish for much less than $3.50 at most convenience stores.\n\nWhere I would consider the sweet a failure - I didn't even finish it - my savory at MAG was actually a unique take on a classic and quite delicious.  Described as a \"classic\" Croque Madame the dish was actually presented in a \"deconstructed\" fork and knife sandwich manner with two large slices of hearty grain bread pan fried in butter and then cut in half, topped with ham and gruyere cheese plus chives, and finished with a sunny-side up egg.  Accompanying the croque on the plate was a simple salad of frisee and vinegar and on a side plate were some oily and uninspiring (and decidedly American) hash browns with Heinz ketchup poured into a small cup.  While good this croque and accoutrements certainly wasn't as good as the version the previous day at Pinot and no-where near on par with the versions in Northern California at Butler and the Chef or Bouchon.\n\nFinishing my meal and sipping on my coffee again my female server finally returned to my table to ask if I needed anything else - when I asked for a \"to go\" cup of coffee plus the check this duty was pawned off on the young man who'd been filling my coffee while she went back to talking to the other female server near the register.  Like Pinot I simply don't understand why \"bistro\" entails sub-par service in Las Vegas and I actually mentioned on my way out suggesting that I wanted my tip (left in cash as opposed to on my credit card as I normally do on vacation) be given to the young man and not my \"server.\"  In general I can't say there is much to brag about at Mon Ami Gabi aside from the view and while the restaurant would certainly stand at the top of French cuisine in Columbus Ohio (my home) I'd much sooner go back to Pinot, Bouchon, Payard, or Tableau when in a dining destination city like Las Vegas.","review_id":"cpxD9Yxtv_xu8lf-q38dJA","stars":3,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":1,"useful":4,"user_id":"U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA","date":"2009-10-12"},{"cool":9,"text":"Wow!

We wanted to sit on a patio and to get there we went trough three or four different dining rooms. The view outside is great, as the restaurant is facing Bellagio and its beautiful fountains. The staff was very nice and organized, we were promptly seated and handed menus. A lot of dishes seemed appetizing so it took a while to order. \n\nFor a starter we shared goat cheese and snails in garlic, butter and herbs. Both were simply delicious! Escargot were best I ever had and goat cheese came with creamy tomato sauce and fresh and crispy baguette. Mmm... Next we all ordered onion soup. It was very nicely prepared, with the melted cheese on the top. I don't know why I ordered it as I absolutely hate french onion soup. It must have been peer pressure :D. However, it was still one of the most passable onion soups I ate. And others like it very much, so it's probably great. After the first course we were already pretty full, but we made a mistake of ordering everything at once, so a few minutes later spinach and salmon salad with walnuts and blueberries arrived before me. And it was a surprising dish. In my opinion a salmon salad always consist of lots of small salmon pieces, not one big hunk of fish and all the other stuff next to it. It was more of the size of the main course and should have been named 'salmon and salad' not 'salmon salad'. But it's all semantics. Walnuts and blueberries gave the dish a refreshing taste, and even though I didn't manage to finish it, it was still very tasty. Our friends decided on salmon tatar with chips and it was probably the weakest part of the meal, but still not bad. It just lacked some herbs or spices. During our visit we also drank a lot of lemonade. At the beginning I made a mistake of ordering home made tea. In Poland, where I live, it always taste sweet, however, as I quickly learned, in America it's just regular tea, only cold. It did not taste good. The waiter was so nice, that upon noticing my mistake, she proposed switching it for sweet lemonade right away. And she didn't even put the tea on the bill. \n\nWe left the place full and content.

It's my spot and hey always treat me well. \n\nHave never had mediocre or bad service. They are very attentive and the floor runs like a well oiled machine. This place puts some serious numbers through the doors on a daily basis. Large space and you will find that every table is sat for dinner seven days a week. I suggest a reservation. They do not take reservations for the outside terrace on the strip that overlooks the Bellagio fountains. Although a true local will figure out ways to get a spot out there w/o waiting with the tourists. \n\nA must try is the \"Baked Cheese\" appetizer. It is a heaping piece of warm goat cheese in an amazing red Italian sauce and spices. Comes with two pieces of fresh warm garlic bread. This has got to be one of the best appetizers in the city! \n\nThey also have great oysters. Always order half a dozen as an appetizer. Tasty! \n\nThe steaks are the winner here. They are as good as the meat served in the finest steakhouses in the top casinos. Order mushrooms or creamy spinach as a side. Two - three people can share a side item. Save room for dessert as that is also the bomb! \n\nOnly have three minor complaints - \n1) Tables in front of the kitchen doors are not ideal and very annoying. Refuse to be sat there as he swinging door will open and close hundreds of times during your meal. \n2) The paper on the table tops is tacky. We deserve a cloth. You can afford to change them.\n3) BRING BACK THE FISCHER BEER!!\n\nThat is it. The price is super affordable and reasonable. Try Mon Ami Gabi and I promise you will not be mad about your decision.

It was roughly 4:00pm or so when our stomachs began to speak to us.  A quiet stomach is usually a happy one, and mine was getting ready to tell me off for not feeding it.  \n\nMy friend said that steak frites makes for a good dish; me being fairly unexposed to French Cuisine, I learn that it's a common dish consisting of a steak and fries.  I like steak, and I love potatoes, so this sounded like a winning combination to me.  \n\nWe wandered through the Paris and looked at the menus of the different restaurants and cafes; surprisingly, the price for steak frites appeared to be cheapest at Mon Ami Gabi!  The other cafes offered steak frites for about $3 to $4 more than Mon Ami Gabi's offering.\n\nSo after deciding, my friend and I enter Mon Ami and are seated quickly, indoors just as we asked.  Water was brought to our table, and we were asked if we knew what we wanted.  It's hard to know what I want when we've been seated for less than two minutes...but okay.  We ask for a few more minutes, and the waitress then explains the day's specials.  My friend and I haven't even ordered yet and we both get the feeling that our server is either having a bad day, or doesn't want to work there.  The next time she comes by, we order the Steak Bearnaise ($23.95), a steak frites dish serve with bearnaise sauce.  While waiting for our dish we enjoy ourselves some french bread and butter.\n\nWhen the food came, the dish was exactly what my friend had explained: steak and fries!  The steak was a thin strip of meat that we had cooked medium.  Fries were thin, crispy, and barely salted.  It made for a very pleasing side to the steak.  The bearnaise sauce was thick enough to coat either the steak or fries when dipped, but thin enough to start dripping off your food if you didn't eat it right away.  A nice buttery consistency and flavor, with hints of white wine possibly.  \n\nThe food was good; something I'd travel back to the Paris for?  Not really.  My rating above is a reflection of the service my friend and I experienced.  We were visited by our server a total of four times during our meal: to bring us water, to take our order, to take our dishes away and to drop off the check.  No asking how the food was, refills on our water, not even stopping by to see how things were after making eye contact with the server.  We didn't feel welcomed, we felt like a burden to the server.  This didn't feel like a French restaurant on the strip, this felt like a bad night at Applebees.  And that's not a hit to Applebees; I'm satisfied with the service at Applebees.","review_id":"Lzrd9zfhFpCld5oEHqHGGg","stars":3,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":1,"useful":2,"user_id":"lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw","date":"2010-07-06"},{"cool":0,"text":"By far my wife's favorite restaurant in town.

Every year, they send birthday gift certificates and discounts off meals at their restaurants in town (El Segundo, Strip burger, Joe's Stone Crab, Mon Ami Gabi, Eiffel Tower restaurant) during the summer months.\n\nWe've used the coupon for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Of the three meals, I give the edge to dinner in terms of value. First things first though - use Opentable to make reservations. Given the location and moderate Strip price point (although kind of pricey still), Mon Ami Gabi can be hopping depending on which day you decide to come.\n\nAs always, they start you off with a warm baguette and whipped butter which you can definitely fill up on. They also serve a small amount of vegetable salad during dinner - once it was an apple/radish dish, another it was a carrot salad.\n\nI must admit, I am kind of boring when I come here to eat and rarely deviate from my routine. I am not usually this bad but this is because in terms of portion size (they tend to be skimpy on serving sizes here)/price point and yum factor, this dish is probably your best bet. I usually get the Chicken Grand-Mere which is a half roasted cornish hen, sauteed mushrooms and lardons, with mashed potatoes for $23.95. The chicken skin a perfectly crispy while the meat is tender and moist. The mushrooms with lardons are a nice combination which goes well with the buttery mashed potatoes. Standard fare but executed well.\n\nThe hubs will either usually get the skate wing or the special of the day which rotates based on the day of the week. The skate wing is truly delicious for $25.95 - if you haven't had it, you should try it.\n\nOur last venture, he had the Friday special which is dover sole lightly pan fried in butter with slightly wilted spinach and roasted potatoes. The dover sole was very good albeit areas were a bit over salted. The spinach was okay. The roasted potatoes were delicious and sported a nice crispy exterior.\n\nWe also came on a Sunday where he ordered the beef wellington special. The beef wellington was okay in my books - the puff pastry didn't really hold up to the moisture of the meat and mushroom duxelle. As well, the meat was a bit overdone from what he had ordered (medium rare was made to medium... this is the tough part about ordering beef wellington).\n\nTo be honest, we normally do not go for the steak frites mostly because I am not a fan of their frites (more of a potato chip texture than fries per se) and from the looks of other table's dishes, the portion sizes of the steak are small.\n\nOverall, if you are coming for a view of the Bellagio fountains, this is an inexpensive way to have dinner with a view at reasonable prices for the Strip. The food is okay and portion sizes are a bit smaller than what you'd expect for the price. Dinner is definitely more reasonable than lunch or breakfast in terms of value and execution.","review_id":"ZySN__m9L21JcBlfLw-dxQ","stars":3,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":1,"useful":3,"user_id":"h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q","date":"2015-09-27"},{"cool":0,"text":"My favorite restaurant on the Strip.

First of all, the ambiance is fantastic. I mean if there were any place in the whole country that you could create a truly \"Paris\" like experience, I would think it would at be the giant multi billion dollar Paris replica in Vegas. This place really feels European, in the sense that you are in a really touristy area of Paris watching Americans and Asians meander by gawking up at the Eiffel Tower and being obnoxious... well ill reserve the obnoxious comment to the Americans. It's not your \"quaint alleyway/place that Hemingway would have hung out\" type of authenticity, but if you're expecting that in Vegas, you are off your rocker anyway - my point is it feels about as authentic as you can get - the food, the decor, the surroundings etc.\n\nThe food is excellent and the service is very friendly (and it's crazy being in a \"European\" place and getting quick service... it feels WRONG!).

My favorite thing about Mon Ami though was the setting/patio and the ambiance. Grab a spot on the patio and this has got to be some of the best people watching in the country. Seriously.

But they took us to a table right next to the patio, so we could see the Bellagio fountains. I ordered the mushroom soup to start off with. It was really good, especially dipping the bread in it! I ordered the hanger steak medium. My boyfriend ordered some sort of fish. He realized that he had made a mistake when he did that. Nevada is a desert, nowhere is there an ocean. Therefore, the fish wasn't as fresh as he would have liked it to be (we're from the San Francisco Bay Area, fresh fish caught and served to you at restaurants there). \n\nI'm a huge fan of the frites and my steak tasted really good, so I don't have much to complain about. The only thing was that our waiter seemed a little...stuck up. I don't know if that was supposed to go along with the theme of the restaurant or what, but he just seemed as if we weren't good enough to be dining at that restaurant.

We were just beside the doors leading to the patio so we weren't bothered by the heat outside, but still had plenty of natural sunlight.\n\nService was great and the atmosphere was spot-on. They brought out batches of fresh bread to newly seated tables all at the same time, so if you didn't get your bread right away--patience, my friend. The baguette was amazing though. Couldn't put it down.\n\nThey were still serving brunch, so my boyfriend got the eggs benedict while I opted for the ham and cheese crepe. My crepe was gooey with warm, melted cheese and stuffed with ham. The ham was a little too salty so I did have to leave some behind on my plate. Boyfriend said his eggs benedict was good, but the english muffin was something else--it wouldn't cut! I even had a go at it and the thing wouldn't budge which made eating a much bigger hassle.\n\nUp next was a bananas foster crepe! It comes out looking like a pregnant crepe, but it sure is tasty. Eat the ice cream before it melts! The sauce was a little too sweet for my liking and I guess they burnt off most of the alcohol (if there was any) since I couldn't taste any flavor of it at all. Regardless, the bananas were delish and the crepe was delish and I'd still gladly order it again :)\n\n**Tip for the MEN: No sleeveless shirts allowed!

Came for a nice dinner out with my mom while she was in town and I wanted to try Mon Ami Gabi; it was definitely the right choice. Our waiter was very attentive without being overbearing (that's hard to do since he came around often but was just so polite and not pushy at all). We had reservations for 8 pm and when we arrived had a 10 minute wait, so we went to the bar to grab drinks in that time. I had a Bloody Mary and my mom had a Lemon Drop Martini (very good). We were seated just in front of the kitchen so there was a lot of traffic going by. In some restaurants I think it can be annoying but it didn't bother me here. Everyone seems very professional, which is how it should be! A lot of people dress up but there are also others dressed casually, so whatever floats your boat, but they do have a no sleeveless shirts requirement for men.\n\nI had the French Onion Soup (yum), my mother had the Chicken Liver Pate which she absolutely loved (I don't really like or dislike pate so my opinion is void), and then we shared the Hanger Steak (the merlot butter was so delicious) and the Seared Sea Scallops. I ordered the steak medium rare but would get medium next time since it was a little tough to cut. Those are seriously the best scallops I've ever had, tasty and soooo tender. My mother also had 2 glasses of the Sauvignon Blanc which was very very smooth. What was refreshing to me was the music. It wasn't just piano instrumentals to fall asleep to, but they played a lot of Norah Jones mixed in with contemporary soft rock/pop songs. That might sound weird how I'm describing it but it was contemporary while still being appropriate for the setting.\n\nOur total was just over $100 including drinks and tip which I completely think is worth it for fine dining without being stuffy and amazing food all around. We were too full for dessert but I'll definitely be back for that steak and to experiment with their specialty drinks menu. I'd also like to sit outside when the weather isn't too hot, it's fun to people watch!","review_id":"NRFBQWnpyY-LPdI8xBR0DQ","stars":5,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"v8QVTSPCW1LBzE_j_jT7YQ","date":"2010-08-05"},{"cool":1,"text":"I think overall food is Salty but still good! Kid friendly, not at night (too tight spacing) but if your child is behaved well and doesn't run or scream, this is a great go to family restaurant. Not like Buca Peppo most certainly in ambiance nor cheesecake, just a mix of both and a touch of upscale with the wine glasses.\n\nthe little girl had  her $4.95 kids meal served in cafeteria style glass plate. She enjoyed it like a grown lady with her wine glass of water instead of the offered plastic cup and straw. She got the grilled cheese which i devoured instead while she eyed on butter fresh baby green beans, apple slices, and frites (fries). The cheese is not cheddar so if you want that you have to request. I should have done that and thus the swiss ended up in my hips.\n\nWe started with shrimp cocktail ($12.95) and 1/2 order mussels (10.95).  The shrimp was huge and served on ice, about 5 or 6 pieces. Too little for price! It was good and the only thing i was happy about was that it was smaller portion so we didn't have to box anything home. But if looking at value, it was overpriced.  The mussels was good, sauce not as good as Brunos in Brea, Ca, and mussels were too meaty for my liking.  Then again we are comparing Bruno Italian with Mon Ami French! How dare I !!\n\nEntrees was new york strip steak (39.95) which was good but he got it medium, not typically his taste and so really the review won't be accurate.  He liked it, i did too, we definitely got full from it but I cannot say much about it since i love seafood more.\n\nGot the Sea Scallops ($19.95) which came in 5 pieces with brussel sprouts and cauliflower puree. I ordered side of mushroom ($3.95) which was good but too salty.  The dish didn't need any sides.  The scallops surprisingly made me full! Could be the dressing and buttered thing sin it that fills you up.  It was soft inside and perfeclty seared outside.  I was blown away!!\n\nWill be our go to restaurant again. The bill for all and our carafe of sangria (about 5 wine glasses or maybe 6 depending on how much you pour) was $135.00 or so.  \n\nWe came in at 5.45 pm and by 7:00 pm it was packed and butts were bumping into my face since we sat on table and not booth. It was too tight of spacing and dark!! I don't recommend high heels for older ladies. Hold on to your man or make him hold you when you navigate here. \n\nDo It Do It, Mon Ami Gabi....let's go again!\n\nNote: There is dress code, not strict...but don't come in all torn up!

Being the first person to set an impression on customers in such a fine restaurant you would think she would have better greeting skills. We were then taken to our table by another host who not only didn't say one word to us while we were walking to the patio dining but walked so fast we actually lost him going through the restaurant.

Ever since trying the Australian Wagyu at CUT (Palazzo) last year, NO steak has ever compared until recently. I'm in NO way comparing a USDA Steak to Wagyu b/c wagyu is on a whole other caliber w/ its intense richness from the marbling. However, for the price and quality, Mon Ami Gabi served THE BEST FILET MIGNON I've ever had in my life!\n\nOn Friday, 2/18/11, my friends and I came to MAG for dinner (this was my 2nd visit). Our party of 7 had reservations for 8 PM. We wanted to sit at the outdoor patio but there's a 40 min wait b/c it's a \"First Come, First Serve\" for patio seating (even w/ reservations). We waited for about 25 mins before being seated at the patio. \n\nF O O D\n*CHICKEN LIVER MOUSSE w/ Burgundy Red Wine Mustard ($9.95): OMG, one of the best, if not THE BEST pate I've ever had!\n\nThe pate was so smooth that it spread like a fine triple cream butter on the warm country toast. As you bit into the bread, you get a toasty crispness followed by the rich velvety savoryness from the pate. The sweet and tangy red wine mustard nicely balanced out the richness of the pate and brought together the entire app.\n\n*WARM BRIE CHEESE w/ Black Pepper Honey & Hazelnuts ($10.95): MOUTH-WATERING!\n\nOne cut into the rind and the warm brie OOZED out like lava. Slather the melted brie on the accompanying toasted croutons w/ a little black pepper honey and bits of hazelnut and you get the perfect texture contrast of crisp and soft and flavor combos of creamy, buttery, savory, earthy, nutty w/ a mild pungency, tang, and spice. It was definitely a tantalizing experience for your taste buds. \n\n*FILET MIGNON ROQUEFORT - Special Request ($31.95): THE BEST FILET I'VE EVER HAD!\n\nI requested the 8 oz filet cooked medium rare. As I started to cut my filet, I noticed it took minimal effort as the steak cut like butter which is always a good indicator of a good steak. It was perfectly seared to a medium rare w/ a warm pink center. I took the first bite w/o the bleu cheese sauce and the steak was perfectly seasoned; just enough to bring out the natural beefy flavor of the filet. A gentle slather of the bleu cheese sauce added a creamy pungency that gave the steak a \"bite\" to it while the arugula gave a pop of bitterness to help round out the richness. With each chew, the juice oozed out from the fibers and the filet was so soft and tender that it literally melted like butter in my mouth (similar to a fine wagyu minus the richness).\n\nThe accompanying frites were like lightly salted sliced chips and were addicting to say the least. I ate it w/ the filet to give it a crispy texture contrast and we each saved some for some drunken morning eats. The frites did hold up its crispy texture until the next morning.\n\n*GARLIC SPINACH ($6.95): GOOD!\n\nThe spinach was perfectly cook which was indicated by its vibrant green color. It was soft w/ a slight bite to it and very garlicky. The slight bitterness was the perfect accompaniment to our rich meal.\n\nV A L U E\nFor a French Steakhouse on the Vegas Strip, MAG is very affordable.   \nWe ordered 4 apps to share (we also ordered the mussels and crab cakes which I didn't try) and each person had their own entrée and our bill was ONLY $40/person including tax and tip! That's even cheaper than my dinner last night at a Chinese restaurant in SF's Chinatown!\n\nS E R V I C E\nFriendly, but lacks organization and efficiency.\n\nWhen it started raining, patrons sitting outside started running in. We asked our waiter if we could sit inside.  He said in a condescending tone, \"You'll have to ask the Manager.\" Seriously, WTF?!?! If it was in the forecast that it was going to rain, WHY would you let patrons dine outside w/o any back up plan in the first place? One of my friends talked to the manager and he did find us a table in 5 mins which was a redeeming factor.\n\nOur second waiter was friendly and attentive, although it took over 15 mins to get the bread. Despite this, our apps did come out several mins upon receiving the bread and our entrees 5 mins upon finishing our apps. She also checked on us several times to make sure we were doing ok.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D É C O R\nMAG is a very spacious and charming French Bistro. It's has a classy feel w/o being pretentious. The large indoor dining area has multiple rooms and the outdoor patio sets the stage for the perfect scenic brunch or dinner as you get views of the Bellagio Fountain Water Show across the street and the glitzy night lights of the Vegas Strip.\n\nWhen it comes to Vegas, I'm all about \"Go Big OR Go Home\", however w/ MAG, there is NO need to. MAG serves delectable classic French at a fraction of the cost of upscale restaurants on the Strip w/o sacrificing quality and ambiance. \n\nCome to MAG and use the $$$ you save here for gambling, shopping or in my case, GOOSE which is NO surprise to those that know me...","review_id":"ifVVRkNiWQOr6G1kaMZ4aA","stars":5,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":5,"useful":10,"user_id":"eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg","date":"2011-02-24"},{"cool":0,"text":"Made reservations for dinner here on a weekday.

The inside has a nice ambiance as well, but get a table outside if you can.  \n\nOur waiter was incredibly attentive throughout the meal, refilling water, asking if we wanted more bread (the bread was delicious, btw), etc.  She even anticipated that we wanted separate checks and was more than happy to arrange it, which sadly most restaurants get very bitchy about.\n\nWe all got a steak entree with frites.  Don't order any side dishes - they give you a MOUNTAIN of frites!  I could barely finish half of them.  My steak was quite large as well.

Perhaps it wasn't the best steak I've ever had, but still excellent.  And with the addition of the ambiance and the service, I have to give this place 5 stars.\n\nTo clarify, this is a $$ restaurant if you order a non-steak entree (they have burgers, sandwiches, chicken, fish etc.) or a steak frite entree (the thin cuts of steak) without drinks, appetizers or dessert.

Currently, their Sunday dinner special is Beef Wellington which I've been really looking forward to try.  The only Beef Wellington I've had is the one over at Gordon Ramsay Steak, so I was looking to try one from another restaurant to compare.  Well, I finally came in on a Sunday night for a late dinner and by the time I got seated, my waiter told me that they had just ran out of Beef Wellington.  Nooooooooo!!!\n\nWell, as an alternative, my waiter suggested ordering their Filet Mignon Merlot.  It's actually been a few years since I last ordered steak at MAG, so he enlightened me.  Plus, because it's a different cut of beef than the Hangar and Ribeye I've had before, it still continues my streak of ordering something new on their menu.  And to add to that, I ordered their Wild Escargot de Bourgogne appetizer.  I've never had escargot served this way so I was really intrigued.\n\nWild Escargots de Bourgogne -- http://bit.ly/1BtOrXP\nOven roasted snails, garlic-herb butter\nOh man.  Butter and garlic galore!!  The snails were chewy just like I expected and they were drowned in so much butter and garlic that I couldn't really tell if they were actually snails.  They could've been mushrooms and I probably wouldn't know the difference.  They were was good though.  And with the complimentary baguette, it was the perfect bread to dunk into the garlic-herb butter wells.\n\nFilet Mignon Merlot -- http://bit.ly/1QHYGP5\nButter, red wine reduction\nI understand that Mon Ami Gabi is more of a budget friendly steakhouse that's part of  the middle tier of steakhouses on the strip, but I have to say that this Filet Mignon was awesome!  Cooked to a perfect medium rare and it literally cut like butter! (http://bit.ly/1N0fjPX)  And the Red Wine Reduction sauce just added a more robust flavor to the Filet.  I'm so glad that I ordered this!  Kudos to my waiter for the recommendation!\n\nMon Ami Gabi delivers once again even when there's disappointment with an item being sold out.  I love how there's plenty of 'Plan B' entrees and based on my past visits, I really couldn't have gone wrong with any of them, but I'm glad that I got to try their Filet Mignon Merlot.

I'd pick this place over a buffet as I'm not a fan of stuffing myself until I can't breathe.\n\nSo I made reservations for 6:30pm for four. All of us ordered the most popular item of steak and frites on our last visit, but decided to change it up as soon as our waiter told us about the special. On a Saturday evening, they had the Grilled Bison Ribeye ($40). It only comes in medium rare as it would be too tough if it was cooked anymore. Before our entrees came, we ordered a large carafe of the Frangria ($30), which filled up about five full glasses. It was tasty and you could forget you're even drinking alcohol. On the other hand, the fruits soaked in the sangria was quite bitter and strong. Complimentary bread and butter was also served, which was warm and soft. We even had another helping of bread until our main course arrived. The presentation itself was already quite the perfect on the ribeye. Everything was incredibly flavorful as I hardly had to add anymore seasoning to my dish. Even the string beans, sprouts and sauteed onions had such a kick of saltiness marinated inside. I have to say that their sauteed onions were to completely die for! It was such an incredible combination of the steak and onions with every bite. This is the type of splurge everyone needs every once in awhile --for a juicy, tender slab of meat!\n\nSince we were celebrating my best friend and my birthday, we were even brought out a special birthday dessert. It was an ice cream cream puff drizzled with chocolate sauce.

I made reservations for a group of 7 and we were seated within 15 minutes  at  round table in the corner.  It was the perfect spot!  when you look up, the celings are so high and the hanging lamps were very rustic looking! I loved that they sat us at a round table.  I hate when you have a large group and they seat you in a rectangle shaped table where you have to lean forward to talk or look at the person you are talking to.  \n\nFOOD:\nWe started with the Country pate which was too course for my palate.  We were deciding between the Country or the Mousse, but we all thought the mousse would be too moussey ( is that a word?).  the flavor was spot on, however i would of liked the texture a little smoother.  It was hard to spread on the break because, well it doesn't really spread!\n\nThe Escargots were very tasty and even better when you ask for extra bread and dip it in the left over garlic pesto sauce.  \n\nI think we asked for bread 3 times, and i over heard our waiter say to another waiter, they want MORE bread???  haha. Yes we like our french bread, is that a crime?  \n\nI ordered soup du jour which happened to be cream of garlic.  Could this be a better match for me?  I happen to love garlic so of course i had to order the soup.  It was so good that my two friends sitting on either side of me kept dipping their bread in my bowl!  I was happy to share... they gave such a huge bowl!\n\nFor my entree i decided to go with the scallops gratin which was an appetizer, but by the time this arrived, I was already so full!  The scallops were VERY flavorful.  In every bite you can taste the caramelized onion, Gruyere, Parmesan, and garlic.  You however, don't really taste the scallops at all.  This is definitely an appetizer to share.  Eating four of these bad boys will leave our mouth thirsty for water the whole night!  this is definitly my kinda dish as i love all these flavors, but maybe one would suffice! =P\n\nI tried a few of the other dishes, seared scallops ( it was very fishy and very scallopy.  I would give this dish 2 *.), steak with herbed butter ( the steak was kinda thin and tough 3*).  \n\nOverall, the experience, ambiance, and food was pretty good.  I recommend this for those looking for a romantic restaurant at a good price ( sit outside and watch the bellagio fountain), or those with big groups looking to get a great value in Vegas!\n\nFYI Be careful of the paper covered table.

Thankfully i sat outside..no wait at all for our table (we showed up at 6:30 pm and had a reservation through open table..15 minutes later, huge line outside the door).  The outside was very nice, with a great view of the Bellagio fountains (very romantic)...and even though it was slightly cold outside, they had a good amount of heaters outside to keep things regulated...was very nice outside.\n\nPricing - very, very fair. Considering most meals were $18-20..except for the $29 Filet Mignon Au Poivre I ordered...Starters were around $10 which is very good as well (hell, Chili's costs almost as much for appetizers)...I believe Desserts were around $8. The only thing slightly pricey were bottles of wine (cheapest bottles $28-35, everything else around $40-70).  Total price including (generous) tip for two people, two appetizers, one dessert, two entrees and a bottle of wine (remember i had the filet)..$128. \n\nService - SPECTACULAR. Our server Juan, was very articulate, friendly, on the ball with everything, and knowledgeable on all the foods.  Examples: it was slightly windy outside, my napkin fell, when i went to pick it up, he was there in an instant, picked it up, and told me he'd get me a clean one.  After eating our baguette, while crunching up he baguette paper, he was immediately at my side to pick up the trash, and offered another baguette. \n\nFood - The filet Mignon was delicious, my girlfriend's lemon chicken was perhaps the best chicken I've ever had. At first I was a little scared of having only an 8 ounce steak for fear of being hungry..but i came out quite full..the banana crepe was also delicious. Presentation was nice...although the escargot could've been presented better, but tasted delicious..The Lobster Bisque..was truly to die for.  The baguette was good as well..the Frites weren't my favorite type of frites, but still quite good, filling, crunchy, but with enough potato inside to make it more than a chip. \n\nOverall: The prices are very fair, I highly suggest sitting outside, the service is great ( at least my experience was tremendous).

The two times I've been here for the breakfast/brunch have been really great. The service is amazing and the view from the patio can't be beat. Both times I sat outside on the patio, and you're literally right on the strip which is a nice touch.\n \nThe patio: Patio seating is hands down the best in the restaurant because you get the view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip. Also, the restaurant faces west, so when the sun comes up, part of the patio gets some shade from the shadow of the hotel. Because of the view and ~~ambiance~~, there's a long line for the patio seating especially on the weekends. We got there around 10:30am and we waited about 30-40 minutes. There's a separate line for patio seating, so be sure to sign up with the hosts/hostesses at the correct podium (just to the left of the entrance of the restaurant). If you want to have a shorter wait time, consider coming a little earlier.\n\nThe food: We got the Housemade Country Pate, Corned Beef Hash, and the Prime Steak Sandwich. The pate comes with cornichons, whole grain mustard, and warm toast. It's not as soft and mousse-like as I usually like pate, but they do have a chicken liver mousse pate option that has that softer texture. Either way, the country pate had a lot of flavor, and when paired with the pickled pearl onions, pickles, and mustard, it's amazing. The Corned beef hash is good. The portion is small, but the eggs are cooked perfectly and the sautéed cherry tomatoes are a nice touch. The Prime Steak Sandwich is cooked medium rare with au jus and fries, and the steak is very tender and flavorful. It's not overcooked and rubbery like some other places. \n\nThe service: Our waiter was so nice and inviting. Even though he had a few tables, he still came over many times to see how our food was and to chit chat with us. He has great rapport, and honestly, they should give him a raise. \n\nOverall, the food is good (especially the pate), the patio is the best place to sit (expect a long wait), and the service is wonderful.","review_id":"v88uKfxqKPzdKDdFRgwkCw","stars":5,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g","date":"2017-04-03"},{"cool":0,"text":"Steak frites is one of my favorite dishes and Mon Ami is one of the best that's makes it just right!!!","review_id":"lMFwsDdhDeo2mIDMFxIILA","stars":4,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"xicAM28uKUgma3fE22OfFg","date":"2014-08-03"},{"cool":2,"text":"I was ravenous when we got here.

My special of the day - roast beef sandwich with truffle aioli - was surprisingly small. The meat tasted more stewed than roasted. I also ordered spinach as a side instead of fries, and I've never had it cooked this way before. Usually I get spinach raw in a salad, or completely sauteed. This dish was neither. It looked like the spinach was barely warmed up in a pan, giving it a strange texture, and it was so salty, it was fairly inedible. I tried taking a few forkfuls and gave up.

I didn't even need to let it cool off, and the cheese, while melty, was only ok.

Got the table on the patio we requested, the view was awesome. Bellagio is right across from the restaurant so we can even see the fountain while eating. The restaurant got really busy right around 7:45-8pm on a Saturday night. \n\nWe ordered some frites, soup of the day, sea scallops, pork chop, steelhead (their special that night).  However, there was something wrong with the server. He was not all quite there, twitching, blinking, stuttering, bumping into the backs of our chairs, etc. We received our frites and entrees not long after we placed the order; however, the soup never showed up. We asked the server about it and he was so confused. So we just cancelled the soup as we didn't want to wait.  \n\nFood was okay, nothing special. The frites and scallops were so salty even though they were cooked pretty well. The frites also looked and tasted like the scraps left at the bottom of the pan, brown, over fried crumbs.  The excessive amount of salt totally ruined the dishes. Steelhead was tasty, but we realized that it's 28 bucks when we got the check. It's pretty costly compared to most of the entrees on the menu (average $19-$24). \n\nDefinitely not worth going back again for the food and service. For the view? Maybe. How disappointing!","review_id":"rRWDHC8DafDelvXxuPsYdw","stars":2,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"rwUo0-Bh2ASxO4mNMWWadg","date":"2011-05-30"},{"cool":0,"text":"Always loved the Chicago original, and nice to say they do a great job here, too. The food and drink and execution in the pretty bistro made for a couple nice occasions. Pre-show, had the Country Pate along with the Frites with some wine and champagne. Near enough to the theatre, we lounged for a half hour at the bar, had some witty banter with the bartender and enjoyed ourselves. The Pate hit the spot -- served with delicious mustard atop, with toast points, olives, cocktail onions etc. \n\nThe Frites are, in fact, Flat! But very tasty -- not oily at all, and perfectly crisp. It took maybe 28 seconds for them to appear after ordered. Mmmmm.\n\nThe next day, we returned for a light breakfast. Intelligentsia Coffee, so nice to see you. And the Market Berry Waffle worked great for me. Fresh berries alongside the crisp on the outside, soft on the inside waffles. I asked for the Whipped Cream on the side so I could monitor my indulgence! The real syrup was a nice component as well. I ordered a side of Poached Eggs, too, which helped fill me up more completely. The Bircher Muesli was outstanding -- and apparently not easy to make. If you're so inclined, go for it. The mimosa was a nice reminder of having a lazy Sunday. \n\nLoved also to sit inside but right near the outdoor deck. It's so airy and light out there; really the best of both worlds.

We came with a group of 10 and were seated promptly, with our drink orders taken and fresh bread served. There were a few incidents where I found my dining experience unacceptable:\n\n1. My friend ordered the corned beef hash, and shortly after ordering, the waiter returns and says they are out of corned beef hash. This is disappointing but acceptably okay, but given this is Las Vegas, and a huge restaurant, how do you run out of such a popular dish, especially at a time like Sunday Brunch? I wanted to order this but changed last minute after hearing the special.\n\n2. The second incident was when our waiter told us the specials of the day, so I ordered the \"Portobello\" eggs Benedict. Except, when our food came, the waiter tells me it's \"pork loin\" eggs Benedict instead of \"Portobello\". The thing is, the waiter should've known what the specials were, and second, he should have came back and told me earlier, the same time he told my friend they had ran out of corned beef hash, that the special was not \"Portobello\" but \"pork loin\". I would've have elected to switch to something else. I do not want \"pork loin\" eggs Benedict, and my second choice would've been the corned beef hash, which the restaurant ran out of. The worst thing was that he told me when our food came, so it wasn't like I had any choice to change my order. I was starving and didn't want others to wait for my food to arrive so they could start eating while they already had their food served, and there wasn't really anything else I really wanted on the menu. Had the waiter informed me earlier, at least I could have ordered something else. The waiter, did however, said he would check back to see if I wanted to change my order, and when he did return to check back a long while after, I was more than three-quarters done with my food because I was way too hungry, and I wasn't enjoying the food, but merely eating just to fill up my stomach. I was rather upset by that. \n\n3. The last incident was my other friend's hot water. She ordered a tea, and needed a refill in the hot water. The waiter took the pot, and never returned. When we asked the waiter about the hot water, he replied, \"oh, we gave it to the other end of the table.\" Obviously, the waiter forgot about it and made it up. We ordered 3 hot teas, and now there were only 2 hot water pots. I mean, normally it wouldn't have been a huge issue, but I was already upset from my meal. \n\n4. Given, we had a large party, but the wait was unbearably long. I was starving!\n\nThe service was nonetheless friendly, I wouldn't fault the waiter. The fressi, kale, warm bacon salad was good and light, however the bacon was cold. Both the chicken liver and pate were on par.\n\nIn conclusion, I was quite disappointed with my dining experience. The view was great, they had nice fresh bread (although the butter was cold and hard), and that's where it ends. Given, we had a large party, but the wait was unbearably long.

No ketchup or steak sauce necessary my friends. This is pure meaty heaven.\n\nSeafood Platter: If you don't like seafood, avoid it.

Then we had to wait in small bar area which was awkward because we were standing in people's way. On the bright side, I will always remember the Charger fan hostess because she  reminded the three snooty hostess I was waiting for my table.\n\nDespite the turnoff in the beginning our table was set up right in front of Bellagio's fountains and the view was spectacular. I had the crab cakes with mixed coleslaw for appetizer which was delicious and there were pieces of crab in every bite. For entree I had the scallops with spinach & mash potatoes. The scallops were seared perfectly and  the spinach was really good too. My boyfriend had the Bone-In Ribeye 22 oz  cooked in medium rare with caramelized onions as his choice of sauce. The Bone-In Ribeye also came with frites which were very addicting. If you want to eat steak then the Bone-In Ribeye is a must! The steak practically melted in my mouth and wasn't chewy at all. Three of my friends ordered the New York steak and said it was really good. However, Peter L & Lily L had the Steak Roquefort and was told the meat was too chewy. \n\nOverall, Mon Ami Gabi deserved 3.5 - 4 stars.

Okay, maybe not.\n\nOn a weekday around 9 am, it was nice that a few tables out in the patio were available for us.

I'd be sweatin' like a mad man, all the water misty machines in the world wouldn't prevent me from melting.\n\nRight off the bat, service was pretty bad. After putting our menus away, we sat for a good amount of time, before my wife flagged somebody down. She noticed other people who sat down after us, already getting served. I could see her vein popping out from her forehead as that happened. Uh oh, not a good sign.\n\nFinally when our waitress came around, we got around to ordering our food. I went for the Eggs Benedict, while she went for the breakfast sandwich. My wife seemed to enjoy her food, and I enjoyed my breakfast. I don't usually have eggs benedict too often, but I was definitely reminded at how heavy the dish is.

For the most part, I wasn't disappointed. But there was still room for improvement. Let me explain....\n\nHubby and I came here for my bday and our anniversary dinner (yes, same date. I wanted to make sure he never forgot! LOL), on July 7th. We initially made reservations for the main dining room but, after further review, I decided to cancel that and instead dine out on the much-lauded patio (they don't take reservations for patio seating). After seeing an amazing show, we came here and were told there was a 45 minute wait. We were given a light-up timer disc. In exactly 45 minutes, it lit up like a Christmas tree. Exactly 45 minutes, to the minute. Uncanny. \n\nOur hostess who seated us was lovely as can be. She wished us a happy anniversary and me, a happy bday. \n\nWe were seated under a heat lamp outside. It was chilly and I was freezing. I saw some of our neighbors at adjacent tables rubbing their arms, too, and one family was soon seated at a nearby table, only to tell the hostess soon after that it was too cold for them and they left to be seated inside. So... Ami staff, please up the heat on chilly nights! Thank you!\n\nIt was amazing watching the Bellagio fountain show while we dined. Dinner and a show! It was wonderful.\n\nThe server who brought our waters and bread was great. He took some photos of us and wished us a happy anniversary/bday as well!\n\nOh and the bread! Wow. A real French baguette, \"served\" in a baguette bag, freshly baked and oh so warm, perfectly baked with crusty exterior and warm and soft inside. You just want to dive right in. Seriously delicious.\n\nOur server was a distinguished gentleman who initially seemed somewhat dour and aloof, not smiling and making minimal eye contact. My hubby thought him pretentious but I warmed up to him and saw him smiling a bit a few times. He promptly took our orders and he was somewhat attentive. He never wished us a happy celebratory day, though (unlike the rest of the folks who worked our table).\n\nWe ordered the seafood tower to share and it was fantastic! Lobster and oysters and huge shrimp and a wonderful ceviche and more. What a treat. \n\nWe were too full for dessert, although the dessert menu looked divine. I had some Earl Grey tea. While paying the bill, we saw another waiter go by with some treat/dessert with a lit candle in it, rushing to bring it to another table's celebrant. My hubby and I looked at each other and simultaneously thought the same petty thought: why them and not us??? I know it's a minor issue, and we were both too full for dessert, but the restaurant staff knew it was a special date for my hubby and me - a doubly special date. Why no celebratory cupcake or whatever they were giving out? Just seemed inequitable. Petty, yes. But strange inconsistency nonetheless. This didn't negate in any way from the lovely meal we had here, but it still was off-putting somewhat.","review_id":"u_cBabOlsHGYSMZa8B_EzQ","stars":4,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":2,"useful":0,"user_id":"NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg","date":"2015-07-14"},{"cool":0,"text":"What I Ordered: It was lunch, but I was feeling like eating brunch food so I ordered the Seafood Crepes.

The bread.  My God, the bread.  They give you a mini-baguette of hot French bread (free) with butter and a little plate of vinegary shredded vegetables. (We were given one plate of apple slaw, and one plate of carrot.  Both were good.)  The bread is heaven, and they didn't even make a face when we asked for more!\n\nWe ordered the warm brie appetizer, onion soup, caesar salad, crab cake, and a side of frites.  As a vegetarian, I was a bit worried there wouldn't be enough options for me, but there were plenty.  They have salads, soups, and a variety of vegetarian sides (like mac and cheese, which I will be getting next time), along with a \"vegetable platter\" entree - doesn't sound very awesome, but who knows.\n\nThe brie was amazing.  I will be recreating it at home shortly.  Warm brie with honey, cracked black pepper, and roasted garlic cloves.  Perfection.\n\nThe onion soup was also good, my only complaint is that it was too cheesy.  Sure, I love cheese, but I'd like some soup with my soup too.\n\nCaesar salad was nothing special, and at $8, I won't be ordering it again.  I know, I know, Caesar salads generally aren't special.  I mean, what can you do with lettuce, croutons, and dressing?  You can add capers, for one thing, as I do at home.  And, this salad was over-dressed.  Not horrible, but not worth it.\n\nMy old man said the crab cake was the best he'd ever had, and he has tried crab cakes at many-a-restaurant.\n\nThe frites = In-N-Out fry shnivelings.  And yes, that is a good thing.   They are AWESOME, a must-order!\n\nThe service was quick and friendly, the wait was correctly quoted (30 minutes on a Sunday night), and the prices were reasonable.

This last time I was there, I was able to put all of those past experiences to good use to create exactly the experience I was hoping for.\n\nA few things to keep in mind if you have never been Mon Ami Gabi.  \n\n1 - The best place to sit is on the patio, however reservations are not good for the patio.  The patio is perfect for people watching, and what better place to do some people watching than on Las Vegas Blvd!?\n\n2 - Get there 10 minutes to 11 (when they start serving lunch), put your name on the list for the patio, take the square-light-up-vibrating thingy, put some money in a penny machine and wait to be called.  Our square thing went off a few minutes after 11.\n\nAs far as what made this experience perfect, there were many factors.  We walked in and were seated on the patio at a table for two.  Our server recognized that it was a little warm where we were sitting (full sun) and offered to look for a table that was less sunny.  She found us the perfect table and it wasn't even in her section!  Plus, it was a four top, right in the center of the patio, in the shade, with the most perfect view of the Bellagio across the way.\n\nOf course, the food always plays a huge part.  A glass of house red wine to start is always nice.  The escargot was delicious, I loved using the French bread to sop up the garlic-herb butter left in the dish.  Our beautiful red and yellow tomato salad was light and refreshing with pesto and goat cheese, two of my favorite things! The steak sandwich was phenomenal.  Not too much meat, cooked to our med-rare liking.  Ciabatta was soft and caramelized onions were the perfect complement.  Frites were light and crispy with a little chew so you could taste the flavor and know you were eating more than air.  \n\nWith the Bellagio fountain show kicking off shortly after noon (on Saturday) right as we were finishing the last of our wine and paying the bill.  This was one of my top 5 favorite lunches of all time!","review_id":"45D7EuZb17oPIig4oevq8A","stars":5,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"4DaYRzOMGcn2zoWkHLNBjA","date":"2010-10-07"},{"cool":2,"text":"Location, location, location. That's the best thing about this place. Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good, but what you're paying for is the privilege of dining on the Strip with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. Sunday brunch was crowded but we were smart enough to make reservations on our way down there.\n\nThe outdoor patio is the best spot to dine and if you can't get a seat out there, the space just inside isn't bad. It's like a green house -- light and airy with plenty of windows. Further inside the restaurant the atmosphere changes as the space is darker and more intimate. That might be ideal for dinner, but during the day your best bet is the patio.\n\nThe cream of mussel and saffron soup was decent but the prominent \"seafood\" flavor made it obvious that it wasn't made with the freshest ingredients. The brie and butternut squash quiche ($12.95) was a whole, round, individual-sized quiche. The flaky, crispy crust was the highlight of dish. Not wanting a dish that was too heavy, the lobster tartine ($17.95) was the way to go. Unfortunately, the creamy, citrus flavors dominated the taste of the dish.\n\nThe restaurant is family-friendly. Yes, they've got a kid's menu. The chicken fingers and fries ($6.95) come in a TV-dinner-style tray with three large, thickly coated pieces of chicken, apple slices, green beans, and ketchup. So, if you're looking for a somewhat upscale place with good food to bring the family, Mon Ami Gabi is a good bet. And, of course, if you're on a date, you can't beat the outdoor dining.\n\n3.5 Stars","review_id":"9Cu8_3ZGEf-7ILiq6UttBA","stars":4,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":1,"useful":5,"user_id":"C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w","date":"2012-11-12"},{"cool":0,"text":"Man, I hate to write this review since I've had such good experiences with this restaurant for lunch/brunch and dinner in the past, but, our dinner experience last night was pretty darn bad! It was my husbands 30th bday, which they knew, and at a restaurant like this I'd expect them to pay extra attention to you, especially a party of eight.\n\nOur table was so so cramped. It probably was meant for 6 max. Our waiter was a nice guy but I felt he rushed us in the beginning and almost was giving us a sales pitch for food that night and even for the next morning. It was way too much talking and he didn't even make sure everyone could hear him (it was super noisy). For the rest of the night he was very scarce. I understand it's a busy restaurant but i wished he would have checked on us more.\n\nThe other waitress we had broke the cork of a very expensive magnum of red wine we brought to celebrate my husbands birthday. She didn't even apologize but just looked at us helplessly and we never saw her again. The red was never decanted. The white wine we brought was never chilled. We poured the wine most of the time by ourselves.\n\nI heard others in my party complaining about missing silverware, napkins, forgotten sides, etc. I can't speak for the other entrees but my wild boar ragu wasn't very good. The noodles were flat and super weird, not what you traditionally get with any pasta I've ever had and I've had a lot of Italian. \n\nBasically by the end of the meal no one wanted dessert and we all just wanted to leave.

The garlic herb sauce for the escargot was extremely buttery to the point where I could feel the butter after wiping my mouth. Definitely not appealing. And the escargot was a bit on the chewy side. When the skate wing arrived the aroma was intoxicating. The texture was very light (similar to a tilapia type fish) and the flavors wasn't too overwhelming. I was not a fan of the capers (a bit on the tart side which was a little off putting with the dish) that came with the fish. The chips (made in-house) were extremely de-lish! Probably would buy a whole bag if I could.\n\nFor fish, this place is fantastic. Great atmosphere. Would definitely want to go back to try some other dishes as I'm a huge fan of french cuisine.","review_id":"sVYnsfYle566z9NDu4gKpA","stars":3,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"xoNpQ_DnzNuTbkFPPO0Lgw","date":"2011-04-05"},{"cool":1,"text":"Came here with a reservation for brunch:\n\nFruit boquet: I was expecting something rather large, since the waiter said it'd be bigger than the fruit plate.

It was really hard to cut into the cantaloupe flower as well and it was an overload on cantaloupe. Definitely don't get this...huge rip off.

Boyfriend said he could've made it at home for half the price with even more eggs!\n\nEgg white omelette: It was pure egg white, nothing else. No veggies or extra ingredients...my friend was very disappointed in it. \n\nOverall, Mon Ami Gabi's food is executed well and visually appealing, but it's really lacking in the little twists and \"Oh!\"s that make food EXCITING!

Totally reminded me of being in a French bistro (and yes, I have been in a real French bistro in France). \n\nStarted off with the onion soup au gratin which was tasty and ooey gooey cheesy. I liked how they had slices of baguette with the crust still on which gave it great texture and flavor. I have to admit though that it was a tad salty for my liking but I finished it anyway. \n\nFor our entree, I got the filet with merlot butter and red wine reduction and the fiance got the trout Grenobloise.

I didn't get to try my fiance's trout however it was a rather large portion and he was very content with his rich and savory dish. \n\nI also have to a say that service was superb. They were quite attentive with our drinks with always refilling our glasses when the were getting empty.

I finally had the opportunity to visit this place a short while ago, and suffice to say, I believe that this place serves good food at decent prices, keeping in mind that it is the strip. \n\nI think the reason why this restaurant gets reviewed so much is because of the view. It's the perfect spot to watch the Bellagio water fountain show. And I think that compared to a lot of restaurants on the strip, the prices aren't too unreasonable. They also seem to have a pretty organized and consistent system in place.\n\nFirst, I needed a little drink to quench my thirst. They have a pretty extensive cocktail, beer, and wine list. Since I was in a French bistro, I wanted a French beer. I ordered something called Castellane, it was pretty good. It looked like there was fresh orange in the beer.\n\nOnto my entrée. I've been dying to try the steak frites here at Mon Ami Gabi. I've heard so many reviews about it, so I had to try it. I ordered the one with the bordelaise sauce. I thought the meat was good, and I really like the sauce, it had a nice kick from the black pepper. I liked the frites. They weren't ordinary frites, they were like super thin french fries, and they tasted pretty fresh. I thought it was good.\n\nEven though this is a very busy restaurant, the service was pretty good. If my server was busy with other tables, I could ask another server or busser for anything, and they would help. Plus, if you're sitting outdoors, the view is very hard to beat.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty decent place. I would take some out-of-towners here.

As luck would have it, a table was available immediately for our party and we were treated to a four top up against the rail with an unobstructed Strip-side view of passersby.  Needless to say, it's one of the best people watching spots on the Strip.  \n\nWe started off by sharing orders of the Housemade Country Pate ($10.95) and the trio of artisan cheeses ($15.95).  The portion of pate was surprisingly generous and a great starter.  The cheeses, while delicious, were nothing terribly special or unique and probably a bit overpriced compared to the seeming value of the pate and what we received for the rest of our meal.  The wife and I split orders of the Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich ($12.95) and the Butternut Squash & Brie Quiche ($13.95).  The grilled chicken and brie was topped with caramelized onions and thin slices of green apple.  It was a nice-looking and tasting sandwich and an overall winner.  The quiche was tasty, as well, possessing a nice and buttery, flaky crust.  The amount of food was plentiful for the price.   \n\nFor a national chain restaurant, Mon Ami Gabi impressed me enough to want to check out its location much closer to our home in Northern Virginia.  Mon Ami Gabi served up a solid meal made all the more special by its singular al fresco dining experience.  If you go, go on a good weather day, and sit outside!","review_id":"FfaMPUwGfpUfhUCScRsdhw","stars":4,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":4,"user_id":"le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw","date":"2014-02-05"},{"cool":2,"text":"One of my favorites!

So we ordered a Medium Hamburger with an Egg (eggs are optional, you can ask for it) at $12.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=WY4lwdmOoHEz3kqNbTy5Mg, a Medium Rare Prime Steak Sandwich at $14.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=kuQ8Vgt4HGeAOTzQQMtcUA, and finally a bowl of Four Mushroom Soup at $7.00/bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=n2rWGJfLS5zXk-E9-3oDHg. The soup was amazing, it starts off with a chunks of cut mushrooms at bottom, then the soup poured over it from a kettle of sorts. The soup itself was creamy and thick, loved the texture- it kind of warmed you to your toes in this weather. Then the mushrooms gives of their distinct flavor, it wasn't overpowering so the two went well together. The hamburger: it was huge. The one problem I had with it was that I had a very difficult time eating it. But it was delicious nonetheless! I loved the fact that they made the egg the way I liked it without even asking. It's cooked on the outside with the yolk runny on the inside. I advise to slurp all the yolk before putting the second half of the hamburger on or else you risk having soggy bread for the rest of the meal. The meat was tender, juicy and full of flavor, a definite treat for my taste buds! They also come with these extra crispy fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=ulCtrY7QWobYjGjrS2OesQ in those cool cone containers. I would recommend this (w/ the egg!) if you're looking for something more familiar to your taste. :D\n\nSERVICE: Impeccable. We had a waiter and an assistant waiter, so we were taken care of whenever we needed it. Our waters were always full and they checked up on us around every 40 or so minutes and both of them were very friendly people, I can't recall our main waiters name, but I remember our assistant waiter was named Stephani... Lovely young lady.\n\nAMBIANCE: Very fancy, walls are dark red wood laced with wine bottles with dim lighting to give that lustrous, private feeling so it's dark on the inside. The tables are set with those multiple forks and knives along with wine glasses. Tables are also set with paper tops for easy cleaning. They even have a causal dress code of no sleeveless shirts for men, most of the people that were there seemed almost well dressed, collared polo and khakis, women in nice dress shirts. But it's not mandatory, I think it's the atmosphere.\n\nGotta check this place out if any of you are ever near Paris!","review_id":"C2FAmTK7jTaZmepWf2TtrQ","stars":4,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":3,"user_id":"6nvUppVogRTTwZCgaYCPjw","date":"2011-12-24"},{"cool":0,"text":"The staff is very friendly, the oysters are delicious, the shrimp are huge and flavorful.

It is truly an unforgettable experience.  The costumes alone are worth the trip.  Never mind those \"racy\" costumes you see on the streets of Anytown, USA.  Here in Vegas, it's not \"Slutty Nurse\" or \"Slutty Cheerleader.\"  The theme is just \"Slutty.\"  It seems as though the whole town is trying to get away with wearing as little clothes as possible for it to still be considered a Halloween costume.\n\nThe patio at Mon Ami Gabi is a PERFECT place for people watching on Halloween.  Normally, I would be gushing about the spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains (\"gushing,\" get it?), but that day was all about people watching.  Since the moment we sat down on the patio, it was darn near impossible to concentrate on the menu.\n\nThe dinner menu at Mon Ami Gabi is a very basic one.  This is French food simplified for Middle America.  \"When in doubt, go with steak frites\" - that's my motto.  This restaurant offers a wide variety of steak frites plus a limited selection of fish, poultry and vegetarian dishes.  There is even a burger on the menu, if one is in the mood for Le Big Mac or a Royale with Cheese.\n\nI opted for the Steak Bearnaise with frites and a bowl of sweet potato soup.  My soup came right away, and the presentation was impeccable.  A single piece of meringue looked very lonely on my soup plate, until the waiter brought and old kettle with a real spout and poured some pureed sweet potatoes around the meringue.  It was kind of like Ile Flottante, but with sweet potatoes instead of custard.  Presentation or not, my soup lacked any kind of unique flavor.  It could have used some spices (ginger?  cardamom?  allspice?).  I added some pepper, but that wasn't enough.  Also, did I mention that my soup wasn't even all that hot?  Come on, guys, you have a kettle!\n\nFor a French restaurant, Mon Ami Gabi sure gives you large portions.  My steak frites came on a big plate, with a thin piece of steak literally covered in crunchy, thin frites.  The steak had been pounded with a tenderizer until it was as thin as a tortilla.  It was then marinated in wine (I am just speculating here), grilled and served to us.  It was difficult to say whether the quality of the meat was truly extraordinary, but the steak sure was tender.  Of course if you took an old shoe sole, assaulted it with a meat tenderizer and marinated overnight, it would be nice and soft as well.  The frites were not greasy and begged to be eaten with your own two hands, no fork required.  They were kind of like tiny specks of Lay's potato chips.\n\nWe stayed there on the patio for another 20 minutes after we finished dinner.  Our evening was over, but the Halloween party in Vegas was just beginning.","review_id":"sxlMyTQZoFNdJX5zRc2Rjg","stars":3,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":4,"useful":5,"user_id":"Z7PaVxobw44iejw3hR0UoQ","date":"2010-11-04"},{"cool":0,"text":"Make sure that you get there early enough to sit on the patio for brunch!

Hostess said table should be ready on time but SORRY even though you had a reservation and it was noted outside it's not guaranteed if you want to sit outside its going to be at 9PM  Strike one!\n\nFairly diverse menu French based steakhouse & bistro with some really great Boudreaux wines that were exceptionally priced and not overkill on the markup.  8 in tow for dinner I'll break it down as simple as possible hot French breach loaves with exceptional homemade butter was presented.  Waitress took forever to get to us and even longer to take our order after spending god knows how long chasing our wine down.\n\nAppetizers:  \nFrench Onion soup was good but nothing out of this world for 9.50 a bowl of soup and it was not piping hot, but lukewarm and very little cheese covered the bow.  Big miss here on simple French item. \nBaked Goat Cheese 8.95 & tomatoes sauce with warm garlic bread was better and the Escargot with warm garlic butter was a hit with two of my friends.   The mussels with white wine with herbs were also a huge success. \n\nEntrees:  \nNY Strip 39.95 with Béarnaise sauce was tasteless and cold to the touch and undercooked. Had to send it back but there was not much you could do to fix this.  The Steak Frites were impossible to eat tasteless also and Ice cold.\n\n22OZ Bone in Rib Eye with béarnaise sauce was better juicy and coated properly and it was temperature hot. Steak Frites Ice Cold\n\nDover Sole night's special neither was gummy and not very good nor was the chicken pallard pounded and covered with greens. A dry flat chicken breast that took nothing to make or present but it was screwed up royally.  \n\nCouple of half roasted chickens was OK but again nothing to write home about in fact all the entrees were either OK - passable or downright bad.  Theme of the night all the food was lukewarm. \n\nService she tried to be there but they are just too busy and overwhelmed as the food took over 50 minutes to arrive after ordering and the place is simply a cluster phuck on wheels as far as food and service. \n\nI'm really trying to be objective here for ambiance, etc but the bottom line is the food was mediocre, our reservations were not honored or shall I say ignored request, the food was not hot and the service was not up to par.

With so many restaurants in Las Vegas on the Strip, this is not one we'd necessarily seek out again unless it was a matter of convenience and timing that led us there.  But the outdoor patio seating provides a great opportunity for people watching and seeing the Bellagio fountain both, the food is good and the prices reasonable by Las Vegas standards.  So we're glad we went and can easily recommend it.\n\nSEATING: We were a group of ten and we wanted an outdoor table so some of the folks involved  who had not been to Las Vegas before could watch the Bellagio fountains, right across the street, as they had dinner. \n\nReservations are not taken for outdoor seating, and it was impressive that they could cobble together a table for ten with only about a 30 minute wait at 6:30. But what we learned from this is that Mon Ami Gabi's outdoor patio seating is probably best for couples or groups up to six just for the logistics of putting tables together. \n\nSERVICE: The restaurant was hopping inside and out and yet service was efficient for taking the orders and getting the food to the right diners and served at the right temperature. Not particularly friendly, but efficient worked in this case. \n\nFOOD: For a Las Vegas restaurant the range of choices, all with a French bistro bent, was impressive and the prices seemed more reasonable than other comparable places on the Strip. \n\nAs example, a duck confit small plate that included a good dried cherry garnish was only about $11 and plenty for an entree for a light eater. Same with the crab cake served with a small slaw type salad for about $15. Same for the Caesar salad that was about $10. Steaks (served with pommes frites) for roughly $25.00 each. Scallop entree was about $30. And so on. Meals included some really good, crusty baguette set in the middle of the table in paper bags at the start. \n\nVALUE:  Total bill for ten, excluding cocktails but including a couple of beers, a couple of coffees and a soft drink,  was about $230.  A bargain by Strip standards. \n\nLIBATIONS: While we waited on our table, some of us adjourned to the (tiny) indoor bar for a cocktail. My hubby said his Maker's mint julep was very good and my Sidecar was one of the best I've had. Cousins in law had good things to say about their rum and cokes and whiskey and sodas. Cousin in law who picked up the tab said they were spendy. As I recall, five cocktails topped $60. \n\nAMBIANCE: The outdoor patio can be fun, for the reasons named in the start of this review. The indoor portion of the restaurant is actually quite large and seating in some of it offers a white tablecloth, cozy bistro ambiance. But, the indoor seating adjacent to the outdoor bar is NOT the best in the place...not the charm of inside and not the view perspective of outside and with a lot of traffic through it from wait staff and diners. So we'd recommend avoiding this section of the restaurant.\n\nRESERVATION NOTE:  If you make a reservation (indoor seating only) you will need to provide a credit card.  Two hour in advance cancellation is required or your credit card will be charged $50 per head of the reservation. (Example, for a reservation for six people the default charge is $300.)

Both pieces of steak were cooked to perfection and extremely flavorful. I LOVED the frites served with the steak, they complimented the meat very well. We even had room for some dessert, I ordered the profiteroles which were awesome, the pastry was flaky and tender. The food was great and so was the view. Service was just okay, our server was not very attentive, I waited forever for my drink to get refilled and our water cups were empty for most of dinner. My only other complaint is that when you sit outside you are VERY close to the other people sitting at the table next to you. I guess for a more intimate experience when its busy sit inside...

It would have been a much nicer atmosphere if there were misters or something to cool me down, cause it was hot as a mofo out there!  It was so hot that our butter melted completely in 5 minutes.  I think this would be the only time I would ever prefer chilled butter over room temperature. We thought about sitting inside to escape the heat, but it was dark and depressing in the main dining room.\n\nWe started off with the mussels, which I liked after having one bite but with every bite I continued to take, they just kept getting worse and worse.  I had to quit after 3 bites because they became way to salty for my liking.  Also, there were about 3 unopened mussels, which is grounds for send-back...but I decided to go easy on them, until my entree that is.\n\nFor my main dish, I chose the seared salmon with a lemon butter sauce over orzo.  It was so bland and tasteless, I sent that bitch ass dish back.  The description on the menu made it sound so good,  and I was looking forward to that orzo, but it sucked in real life.  Sorry, but I have no pity for these huge casinos and I am expecting something not dissapointing when I'm dining at any one of them.  My bf liked his dish, though.  Maybe I chose the wrong thing, but I doubt I'll be giving them another chance to redeem themselves.\n\nThe view of the Bellagio fountains was entertaining, which was a plus.

The fruit basket was half of a cantaloupe cut to look like a flower with mango, pineapple, strawberries, grapes and berries inside. It was almost too pretty to eat. It also came with brown sugar, yogurt and a clear sweet syrup on the side. The fruit was all fresh sweet and ripe. The omelette was a nice size portion with tomatoes and avocado ontop. It was a little bland but the hot sauce I asked for spiced it up. I am not a hash browns fan but theirs are very good with grilled onions through out. \n\nService was okay. Our waitress wasn't the warm and inviting type but got the job done. We did have a couple of times that we had to wait for the coffee and water to be refilled. \n\nThe decor and layout reminded us of the cafes we had dined at when we were in Europe so Mon Ami Gabi did that correct. \n\nPrices is great for the quantity and quality of the food.

The outdoor seating at the time was pretty crowded so we opted for inside seating since the wait was only a few minutes.

The steak was very reasonably priced for the size. It was larger than I expected and for the most part it was tender. The butter was green and I'm assuming it was blended with parsley and some other greens to give it that color. The butter was surprisingly flavorless. I had to add some salt and pepper to give it more flavor. The fries were more of thinly sliced potatoes, but they retained way too much oil. They definitely didn't take out the additional oil on the fries. The dish was good for the price in my opinion. The flavor was the thing that killed it for me though. 3/5\n\nAverage food with a nice ambiance in Vegas. There's too many other places with good food in my opinion.

If you have been to Las Vegas, you have likely walked past this French brasserie; it is the one with the big outdoor patio just outside the Paris hotel that looks like either a great spot or a very hot place to have brunch or lunch.  Mon Ami Gabi is from famous Chicago chef Jean Joho, who also runs Paris' fine dining restaurant The Eiffel Tower Restaurant and Chicago's Everest.\n\nWhile I was not a fan of The Eiffel Tower Restaurant, I was looking forward to trying Mon Ami Gabi.  This French brasserie seemed like a good choice for a delicious but not too expensive brunch.  I really liked the look.  The outdoor patio can be nice during some parts of the year and the restaurant also has an indoor-outdoor dining area, which offers a good view and a lot of sunlight but still provides a French bistro-esque room with good tables and a comfortable temperature.\n\nMon Ami Gabi's brunch menu features a mix of breakfast and lunch dishes from Eggs Benedict and omelets to steak frites and sandwiches like the Croque Madame, which I ordered.  Unfortunately, it was not good.  The ham was too thickly cut and quite dry while the toasted bread was dry, hard and way too crunchy.  The cheese did not have that stretchy and melted quality that a good Croque Madame has.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=RSpAHvSIkAL21g6FHhd-Mw#8hc0hKwEWBkyr-oSH8V1dA\n\nThe Croque Madame was topped, of course, with a fried egg.  Unfortunately, the fried egg was quite burnt around the edges.  The fries had a thin potato chip-like cut.  They were not super crispy, but I liked the soft insides contrasted against the crispy edges.  Unfortunately, the fries were quite salty.\n\nFor dessert, I had their profiteroles and this was a much better representation of a classic French dish.  The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.  The chocolate topping was not the traditional thin dark chocolate sauce.  Instead, it was a thick double fudge sauce. While I prefer the more traditional thin bittersweet chocolate sauce, the chocolate combined with the ice cream and pastry to make a satisfying dessert.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=RSpAHvSIkAL21g6FHhd-Mw#3Vy7BG3KJjbNjcREFoUeJQ\n\nService was good.  My server was very pleasant, polite and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.\n\nPrices were not too bad for their breakfast and brunch options.  Some of their steak dishes seemed pricey, but they were similar to other Las Vegas restaurants though Las Vegas restaurants tend to be very overpriced.\n\nBouchon is Las Vegas' signature French brasserie, but I try to seek out other places.  Bouchon is perfectly fine, but it feels very similar to the Bouchons in Yountville and Beverly Hills (in terms of food, the Yountville location is easily the best of the bunch).  Mon Ami Gabi offers a more unique experience for people on the West Coast (Mon Ami Gabi has several locations in the middle of the country and the East Coast).\n\nUnfortunately, the food at Mon Ami Gabi was simply not that good.  While I liked Mon Ami Gabi's service and atmosphere, Bouchon is a much better option if you desire a French brunch (or dinner); it would probably not cost you that much more either.  Comme Ca in The Cosmopolitan would probably also be a better option for French bistro fare than Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nLike most Las Vegas hotels and casinos, Paris offers complimentary valet and self parking.","review_id":"9_e36gtVXGE_94-cRiK1Tw","stars":2,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":16,"useful":24,"user_id":"w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ","date":"2014-03-19"},{"cool":0,"text":"I went here twice for breakfast last week and Mon Ami Gabi is now my goto place for breakfast in Vegas.  In fact, I think I may have to stay at Paris next time I go just so I can roll out of bed and into that restaurant.\n\nI had the french toast the first day and a ham and cheese omelette the next.  My honey had steak & eggs the first day, and french toast the next.  (I stole a bite of his steak so can comment on all three dishes).  Everything was really good.  \n\nThe french toast was different than your usual american french toast but was delicious, I love the generous dollop of whipped cream and all the blueberries and blueberry syrup.  They use two thick slices of bread, I am not sure what kind of bread but it's not your typical french toast sourdough or texas toast.  It was neither soggy or hard, was perfectly 'egged', and just the right amount of food to be comfortably sated without being stuffed.\n\nThe steak on my honey's steak and eggs was peppery and flavorful.  Sometime I need to come back for lunch so I can order the steak with roquefort sauce....mmmm!\n\nMy omelette was perfect as well - not greasy, but fluffy, with ham and gruyere.  The hash browns were perfect, buttery and herbed without being greasy, hard or soggy.  I loved the whipped butter and fresh raspberry jam that came with the crusty bread as well.  \n\nAnd to top it all off, the prices are not bad by Vegas standards.  Most of these dishes were about $11 (except the steak and eggs, which was a bit higher).  Let me tell you I've had FAR crappier breakfast for much more money many times in this town (both on the strip and off).\n\nService was very good, as a tip I'd suggest eating inside rather than outside, it's quieter and easier to get a table and it's not 100+ degrees.  Win-win!\n\nFor all these benefits, I give them the coveted 5 star rating.  It would be nice if they gave out total reward points, but they are apparently separate from the casino.

(Now I'm kind of kicking myself because reading my last review, they had the same special for benedict...ooooph). The coffee continues to be good, they use Intelligentsia, so it is consistent with other tasty coffee places.

I didn't really mind, but to be technical, it was incorrect. The egg was cooked correctly. The whole thing was really very tasty.

After living in Vegas for 8 years, I've never been and have always wanted to try it. A friend wanted to come here for his birthday, so 4 of us came for dinner on a Friday at 7:30pm. They don't take reservations for the patio so we had to wait, and the restaurant bar was crazy packed, so we went to the casino bar right outside and ordered a drink. Which, unfortunately we had to throw out when our table was ready since they wouldn't let us bring them in. We sat outside and the view was very nice, so glad they had heat lamps because I was worried about being cold out there but I was comfortable. The wines by the glass were pretty pricey, but I ordered a glass of red. I had a hard time finding anything on the menu because I wanted to eat healthy, and even the fish dishes were all seared, and served with rich sauces. I ended up ordering a spinach salad with salmon, which was fine but nothing memorable. The french baguette they brought out was pretty good. My boyfriend's scallops were a pretty small portion and just looked ok. I tried the chocolate mousse for dessert and that was nice, I'd say it was the best part of this meal. 2 of us were finished with our drinks halfway through dinner but we were never offered another round. Our waitress was not personable at all, which was unfortunate because we all work in the service industry and of course we still tipped 20%, but she would have likely gotten much more if she had seemed even remotely interested in serving us.

They have beautiful seating on the patio and in the \"bubble\" -- like an atrium, this area is covered by glass with great views of the strip. This is our favorite location to eat in the restaurant as I personally feel that service can suffer farther out on the patio.\n\nInto the food:\nAppetizers: \nTheir Sea Scallops Gratinées is a completely flawless dish-- tender scallops served in a sort of seashell presentation, topped with a carmelized onion marmalade, mussel cream, and carmelized fennel(?). While this normally would not appeal to me in the slightest, this is probably the dish I look forward to most when coming to Mon Ami Gabi! These are downright delicious and should definitely not be passed up. I believe there are 3 in an order. \nFrench Onion Soup: My favorite of all time. Nowhere else have I dined at has surpassed MAG's french onion. I can't even describe it anymore without my mouth watering...a ton of sweet onions throughout is what I love most about this. I can't explain anymore without saying to just get this!!\n\nMain dish:\nWarm chicken & brie sandwich: This is quite the item. The chicken is pounded flat and is incredibly tender. The brie is smooth and is a great mix with the green apple slices (also thin) and the spread of carmelized onions (notice the trend with the onions...ha! I love them.) I forget the bread it is on, but it's extremely soft and a perfect match. However, I could pass on their fries. They're so thin, they become crunchy, almost like chips. But, to each their own!\nI've had a few others, but this has been my favorite by far. \n\nDessert: \nWarm Apple Tatin: Extremely French taste, presentation, etc...I was transported back to France just tasting this. It's difficult to explain this item, but it is a round crust (bottom and sides) and it has baked, carmelized apples in the middle. Served with amaaaaazing whipped cream. Worth every calorie!\n\nBottom line: One of the best places on the strip for lunch that is decently priced.

Not to sound unimpressed, pretentious and a mega jerk but most fine dining restaurants in Montreal and Quebec will do a great job of frites steak. Also, many restaurants have excellent selection and usually 10+ different ways of serving frites moules. So....eating French in Vegas is a bit kitschy for this guy. But of course it serves the Paris well and those who live far from France or Quebec. \n\nWhen you enter the restaurant it sure gives you the feeling of being in a Paris bistro in some back alley arrondissement. They did an admirable job here in decor and design. If you can get a table on the patio you have some fantastic views in the evening of the Bellagio fountain as it goes off. \n\nSince we gorged ourselves on the Bachannal Buffet (Caesars) earlier I was not super hungry.

I've heard many good things about this place, and I like that it's not super expensive as most Vegas restaurants are. Service was impeccable from the beginning, and our server (Jeremy) was courteous, efficient, and hovered just enough. Our water glasses were always filled, and we never had to wait to ask for anything.\n\nWe started our meal with drinks - le moine (I think? it was the one with ginger beer) for me, and a blue moon for him. I thought it was nice that even though we said we didn't need a glass for the beer, he still brought one out (with an orange, no less) \"just in case\". Very thoughtful. We also started with the salmon tartare, which was nice and refreshing and perfect for the hot weather (we were lucky to be early enough to get a patio seat but we were seated in the corner with no air from the inside coming through to us). I liked the avocado with the salmon, and the chips were good (maybe a little more salt would've been nice?). It also came with olives, pickled peppers, and pickles.\n\nFor our mains, I had the filet mignon merlot which was nice and tender at my requested medium rare. BF had the 22oz ribeye and the first bite of that was perfection - nicely seasoned and so juicy. Both our steaks came with frites, and as BF puts it, they tasted \"like the last of In-N-Out fries that no one wants\". They were flat, very crispy, and needed to be dunked in ketchup or some kind of sauce to have more flavor. We both would have liked to have subbed the frites with another side instead. As for the steaks, I think as the meal went on, and they cooled down, the wow factor decreased, and by the end, we felt they were good, but not memorable. We also had a glass of pinot noir with our steaks, and that was fine but not one of the better glasses we've had (not as smooth and buttery as we've come to appreciate from restaurant wine).\n\nOur meal ended with complementary cream puff & ice cream since it was my birthday, which was sweet. Ice cream was good, cream puff was meh. But it's free, so can't knock 'em for that.\n\nIn the end, we left feeling like it was a 3-star meal. Food was good, but again not necessarily something we'd keep coming back for. Had it once, and that's enough for us. But, drinks were good, and service was great.

I'd been wanting to try it for a long time, so it was the perfect opportunity to sample the restaurant on the cheap.\n\nI called for reservations at around 6 pm, and when I was told their first available was at 9:15, we decided to take our chances with the line.  We got beepers for both the patio and inside, and the 45 minute to one hour wait turned out to be pretty accurate.  The patio beckoned first, and I sure was happy about that!  No matter how many times I see the Bellagio water show, it never ceases to delight me.  And though it was a chilly night, all the propane heaters blasting away kept my left side warm enough to remove my jacket.\n\nI ordered a glass of rosé, and it was great that the waiter brought out a bottle and poured a taste for me.  I hated the rosé, since I'm not a fan of dry.  So much better than having a bartender do the pour, and then have to send the whole glass back or tough it out.  The waiter asked what kind of wine I like, and came back with a fresh glass and a bottle of Vouvray.  That wine was perfection!\n\nHubby and I shared a hanger steak and a salmon/spinach salad.  I ordered the steak medium rare; he likes his steak cooked to the consistency of shoe leather, so I knew he'd be sending his half back.  Turned out he had to:  the steak was still mooing.  It was on the live side of rare, but it was so delicious that I forged ahead.  He sent his back to be cooked medium, and it came back the way it was originally ordered, i.e., medium rare.   In an attempt at health-consciousness, we had asked if we could substitute the garlic spinach for the frites, and the answer was \"yes, for a two-dollar upcharge.\"  The spinach was so good we were happy we'd done that.  But when hubby's steak was returned, it was garnished with that big portion of frites that we'd spurned.  There went the New Year's Resolution, and they stayed crispy down to the last one.\n\nThe salmon was a rather thin portion, and a bit OVERcooked.  Though many people don't prefer it, a really good restaurant will undercook salmon.  But the flavor was delicious, and the citrusy dressing on the spinach was delicate and not drowning the dish.\n\nThough the food wasn't cooked to the highest standard, it was terrific, nonetheless.  Add a great baguette, wonderful service devoid of any hauteur (our waiter was Mexican), a fabulous glass of wine, and a sublime, even romantic ambiance, and you have the reasons for my five stars.","review_id":"m958gJLKN1xs82elCXAGWg","stars":5,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q","date":"2012-01-12"},{"cool":0,"text":"Great ambiance, great service , great food.

When the weather is nice the patio seating at Mon Ami Gabi...on the Strip...is an easy 5 Stars!  Directly across from the fountains at the Bellagio, the patio is superb for people watching and taking in the sites.  I would not eat inside.  The food is all above-average, but for me it's the patio that sets it off!\n\nWe come here for brunch on special birthdays and other special occasions.  They do all their meals well here, and just being here elevates the mood, and meaning of the special day!  You will pay more to eat on the Strip, but the food is spot on and the venue is outstanding.

It was fantastic! We ate outside on the patio around 10pm on a Friday night and it was still fairly busy. It was cold, like 40 degrees, but the patio had heaters everywhere and that made it comfortable enough to eat (with your coat on). It is arguably one of the best outdoor eating spaces on the strip. You can easily see the fountains of the Bellagio shows and watching the people on the strip is always entertaining. In fact, next time my friends and I are going to play some people watching Bingo while eating dinner here!\n\nWhile Mon Ami Gabi could rely solely on its location, the food is actually quite delicious and the service was fantastic. My husband had the bone in rib-eye steak and it was cooked perfectly for him. The Bearnaise sauce was lemony and a perfect compliment to the steak and a great dipping sauce for the frites. Oh the frites! They don't look like much at first but they have the flavor of a fry with the crunch of a chip! A delicious pile of perfection. \n\nI had the chicken Paillard with their mashed potatoes. The waiter suggested one of us try the mashed potatoes instead of both of us getting the frites and I was so thankful for that recommendation. The mashed potatoes were impeccable. I think I ate almost the entire pile before my husband got a bite. They were creamy and delicious and most likely overlooked since everyone raves about the frites. The chicken was also very good and served with fresh lemon and herbs. \n\nOverall, we had a great experience. The service was some of the best that I have ever received, our server was funny and made helpful suggestions. The view was fantastic and the food was delicious and affordable by Vegas standards.

I think the most memorable thing about this place is that when you sit outside you get to see the Bellagio water show. I find that quite nice if you are enjoying your lunch or dinner and you get a pretty nice water show performing. \n\nFood was alright. I think if i never tried Zazie then this place might just be 4 stars but it just wasn't what I call AMAZING. I didn't expected much but for some reason I find myself leaving the place quite disappointed. I think the thing that got me the most was the fact that it was warm when the food was deliver to our table. I don't get it...the dishes should of just been cooked for us and the food is warm? If you are a pretty high up there restaurant, you just don't expect to see this kind of features. I'm just not satisfy with the fact that we were brought out with warm food. It absolutely makes no sense to me. \n\nI think the bread was very disappointing. I really hated the bread that they provided us. It just didn't meet any of my high class restaurant's bread. I mean I can go to Coco's and they can serve me better and more delicious bread than them. The bread was just plain dry and it was pretty hard to bite off a piece because it was crunch. YEA...didnt like it much. \n\nTO THE MAIN ENTREES\n\nI got the Croque Madame which was alright. After I tried Zazie, it's just alright in my book. The thing I find my Croque Madame quite oily? It's okaay i think i can kinda overlook that. I also tried the French Onion soup which was quite nice. I actually find the French onion soup the most enjoyable EXCEPT that once i dig my spoon under the cheese the soup was still quite warm. Which is a big WTF for me. I tried two other dishes but as yea I think the overall was an alright to me. \n\nService...it was a so so. At first I thought the waiter was quite nice and refreshing because it seems like he is trying to have a great convo with us. You know after the main entrees was serve to us...it was like he became a ninja and just kinda disappear. The leaving experience was a lot worst.The reason why is that we asked for the check and he just forget about it. So we were sitting there for a good 10 mins until we finally asked for it again. THEN we finally got the check and leave.\n\nIt's not a must try place in my book but I wouldn't kill myself if i had to come here again.","review_id":"g1vD22qKCLNVXOtsv3VfWg","stars":3,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"SqjP1cV8JwDdN0K9QULzog","date":"2010-09-18"},{"cool":1,"text":"Great ambience, patio seating is worth the wait.

But since Fran ordered it I decided to try something different.\n\nI ordered the Pulled Pork Brisket Banh Mi sandwich. Served with sriracha mayo and pickled vegetables, and cilantro. There was a little more mayo then I like, but it was easily overlooked after a bite or two, It's a sandwich you will have to lick your fingers while devouring.\n\nWe both had hand cut frites with out meal.

You sit literally on the strip across from the Bellagio water show that plays every half hour. It's the the best outdoor style cafe experience in Vegas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=NTpchPgwPnFIER56x1dz1Q#NTpchPgwPnFIER56x1dz1Q).\n       - Weather - I'd never come to Mon Ami Gabi to sit inside; so, I'd recommend checking the weather and reserve the day of. You wouldn't want a wind, rain, heat, or cold to ruin your dining experience. Unfortunately since this is Vegas, there aren't many temperate days.\n       - Steak - The steaks were thin and not from a good cut. I cut into a couple tendons throughout my dinner. They cooked them well, but it still didn't makeup for the poor piece of meat.\n       - Price to Quality - I'd say the price to quality of the steaks is pretty low. They cook them flavor-fully and well, but bad steak is still bad steak.\n       - Frites - All the steaks are served with these chip-like french fries. It was a nice change, but I think I'd still prefer mash if I could have it.\n**Ordered**\n       - $10.95 Escargots (in garlic-herb butter) - 6 delicious snails that were of decent size (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=ex6ZPq9Ver6siPR-2Sq0HQ#ex6ZPq9Ver6siPR-2Sq0HQ).\n       - $25.95 Steak Bordelaise (Caramelized onion, red wine sauce) - I liked this better than the other sauce. It definitely brought out the sweetness of the onions (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=bp-adB6a359T2vZJyZukFA#bp-adB6a359T2vZJyZukFA).\n       - $25.95 Steak Au Poivre (Brandy peppercorn sauce) - I like peppercorn, but I think pepper in this was a little overpowering (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=3xiPElJcOtMrOUnJyi2RHg#3xiPElJcOtMrOUnJyi2RHg).\n**Recommendations**\n       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice date place and the weather is nice outside. Sitting outside, across from the Bellagio fountains definitely a unique experience. If you're not planning to sit inside, I'd say there are many other better places for this price.","review_id":"8NU9_kNkz1kiAlwtScFQqA","stars":3,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA","date":"2012-05-01"},{"cool":0,"text":"We had a pleasant experience on a previous visit, this time, not so much.  We visited on Saturday to celebrate my DIL's graduation from law school.  We originally had a party of 10, but 3 fell out, thankfully.  They had set up a 7 or 8 top table with 10 place settings.  The chairs were actually smashed against each other, if we had 10, there was no way to sit.  The table was IN the bus station/cash register.  Not 2-3 feet away, right against the table, one of our party had a waiter's butt against the back of his head for the majority of the meal.\n  We sat down, and 20 minutes later, a waiter (who had been stealing glances at the table) asked if we had been helped; NO. When we finally got a waiter, he really attempted to provide good service, but he was by himself.  The busboy had no idea what the heck was going on, maybe he was new or high.

No refills from the busboy, he tossed the bread on the table and ran...etc., very poor.\n  The escargot was about as bland as I have ever eaten and the house steaks were  thin as paper, and cold.  One guest specifically asked for no fries, and wanted veggies instead; nope, out came fries.  Like I said, the waiter tried, but it was an uphill battle.

From start to finish, the whole experience was 5 stars!\n\nI had made a reservation for 9pm, and we were advised that if we wanted a table outside (which we did) that there may be a wait. So we headed to the Paris about 40 minutes before our reservation time. I spoke to hostess and requested a table on the patio, and asked if we could try to get a table fairly up front and centered, so we'd have a good view of the Bellagio and the fountains. She said she would do her best. Half an hour later, we were being shown to our table by an incredibly friendly hostess who made conversation, and didn't just take us to our table like sheep. \n\nOur table was perfect! Right up front and dead center. We were able to people watch, and the fountains at the Bellagio really helped set the scene for a romantic dinner on our last night in Vegas. \n\nOur server was attentive, but not overly so. Knew the menu, knew the specials, and was able to make recommendations. Friendly but not in your face. Efficient but not cold. \n\nThe food was perfect. We started with the onion soup and warm brie, both were gone within minutes. Be forewarned, however... the onion soup is not the onion soup you find at your average American restaurant. A nice big crouton, plenty of melted cheese, and that slight sweetness that you should have in a good onion soup. The brie was ridiculously good. Melted and gooey, drizzled with a peppered honey, and whole cloves of roasted garlic. The baguette they bring you to start is warm, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, and the butter is soft and spreadable (HUGE brownie points for that!). \n\nWe both went for the steak frittes: my partner getting the steak au poivre, with the peppered sauce, and I ended up getting the bourdelaise and the bernaise sauce on the side, because I couldn't decide which I wanted. Both were amazing, but I ended up pouring the light, slightly lemony bernaise on to my steak, which was perfectly rare and melt-in-your-mouth tender. The frittes were thin and cooked perfectly. We shared a side of ratatouille, that had incredible flavour and complemented the steaks perfectly. \n\nA perfect end to our trip.","review_id":"wkC72FBoCkFlk7sik_QjSw","stars":5,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":1,"user_id":"N-pWt7EPsPotH-yQEOfqKQ","date":"2012-07-11"},{"cool":8,"text":"After seeing the 8:00pm show of Absinthe nearby, Minh, and I were trying to decide what to have for dinner.

Not the smell, not the look, but the sound of the crust.\"  The bread here is just like that.  Of course it looks and smells delicious, but when you break that first piece off, it makes that crisp crackling sound. \n\nAppetizer: I get a full order of the MUSSELS MARINIÈRE and share it as an appetizer.

High volume is during the weekends for dinner. PLEASE try to make a reservation during the times of Christmas, NYE, and Valentines Day season. It will be very hard to get a walk-in. There is also many sections of the restaurant to be seated at. First room is the wine room, which is midly dark. Chose this room if you are there for drinks or for 'intimate' time. One problem is that it is near the front where people are walking in and out constantly. There is outside seating available, which faces the strip and Bellagio fountains. It is both good and bad, since some annoying tourist might bother you while you are eating. But the fountain show is wonderful to watch while outside. There is also a room that is inside but right behind the patio, so you get all the ambiance of the patio but you are technically inside.\n\nI believe I have eaten here four times. \n\nThe first time was with a friend for lunch and both the food and service were excellent. We were walk-ins on a Saturday during lunch. We were seated outside facing the bellagio fountains, which was beautiful.  I had clam soup, brie & garlic, Shrimp Gabi and escargot. We also ordered the Pinot Gris, which was excellent with the meal. The price was reasonable for the quantity and quality of food we had (the bill came to about $120US). Everything was flavorful and fresh. Based on this meal alone, we would highly recommend this restaurant.\n\nSecond & third time was with my friends (who are yelpers as well). The third time, we sat in the room behind the patio (since it was hot outside).  I basically ordered all the same things from the first visit and it tasted just as good. These times, were had ordered dessert, which was a vanilla type of milkshake. It was incredible. \n\nFourth time, I will say I was disappointed in both the food and service. Perhaps cause one of the individuals with us was a friend of the assistant manager, and it seemed that we were being ignored or just not waited on as well as others there. The service at lunch was erratic and inattentive though the restaurant was not that busy than it had been at any of my previous meals. I wanted to try their Quiche and was not impressed. It was dry with very little flavor, and bland.  My boyfriend's meal was no better, which I believe was a steak of some kind. It was pretty dry.

With coffee and o2 in hand, we were off to a great start!\n\nOur server was congenial, efficient and helpful with the menu, as well.  \n\nWe went with the famous Croque Madame, traditional eggs and sausage with crispy hash browns, large mixed berry crepe, and corned beef hash & poached eggs, respectively.  \n\nThere was a bit of a wait but nothing too bad and the food was definitely worth the wait! Everything was fresh, nicely plated and the portions were very generous.\n\nOur coffees were always topped off and waters constantly filled without asking, which was nice. \n\nOverall, a fantastic breakfast stop at Mon Ami Gabi.

Slowest brunch service I have ever experienced and in the US. We arrived around 1:30pm and waited about 15 mins to be seated inside. The wait for the patio outside was 1.5 hours. We were seated across from the kitchen, with the swinging doors to our back. Once seated it took our waitress forever to take our drink orders, take our food orders, bring out the food and give us our check. It took so long. But apparently, that is what happens in French restaurants. I had the eggs benedict and something was off about it. Something sour. It was hard to get past the sour taste. The mimosas were good. I enjoyed them. My friends ordered orange juice and received them with ice. Lots of ice. Weird. My boyfriend got the corned beef hash and that was pretty good. Coffee was french pressed and good. \n\nTo summarize, be prepared to wait for everything. Wait to be seated, wait to get your order taken, wait to get your food and wait for the check to arrive. I probably would not recommend this place for brunch. I've had better food/service in Vegas elsewhere. P.S.

I wasn't able to opt for the extra 15-minute wait for patio seating (it became a 30-minute wait by 12:45), but I think it's worthwhile.\n\nGetting to my table was quite the ordeal. I was told that my table was being prepared when I checked in, however, I was still waiting after several other groups, most arriving after I did, was seated before me. I finally approached them after almost ten minutes and this was followed by a few more minutes of \"here's your table, nope, it's not available, waiting awkwardly, walking around the dining area, here's another table in the dark, there's other tables available, but not for one person, etc.\" It's a long story and I've spared the details. I was finally seated at a table next to the window overlooking the patio and it was very pretty. \n\nBecause of the lengthy windows and almost dome-like ceiling of this area, it's a wonderful alternative to their coveted patio dining. You still have a really great view and the light is magnificent (probably not so much in the summer). Although, if you sit right along the glass, like I did, you are awkwardly close to patrons on the other side. Besides the odd setting, I think this indoor \"glass room\" is better than actually sitting outside. You still get all the benefits of the restaurant's location without the car and foot traffic, outdoor elements, and people gawking at you.\n\nYou start your meal with fresh, warm baguette and creamy butter. I love that the loaf arrives in a \"Mon Ami Gabi\" bag, where you just tear off pieces to eat and it allows for easy travel. The bread had a great crust and soft, chewy center. Delicious.\n\nI had the Wild Escargots de Bourgogne ($14.95), oven-roasted snails in garlic herb butter, and Seafood Crêpe ($15.95) made with scallops, shrimp, peas, and cream, served with a frisée and vinaigrette salad. The escargot was delicious! Especially that butter. Since it's served in the specially-made cast iron pan that it was baked, the dish is still warm until you're done. The \"sauce\" is extremely fragrant and went perfectly with the baguette. The crêpe was wonderful, filled with light cream and peas, topped with scrumptious scallops (it comes with two pieces, however, they're most likely one big scallop sliced in half) and plump shrimp (three nicely-sized crustaceans). The light and refreshing salad was a great companion as well.\n\nService was very pleasant and quick to respond to my needs and necessity to finish my meal in the allotted time.

A pot of black tea for me and endless refills of black coffee for my guest were just what the doctor ordered.\n\nThe portions at Mon Ami Gabi are behemoth, so we knew that one small plate and one regular plate would be more than enough food.  We started with the fruit salad with brown sugar and yogurt, which was simple but fresh and tasty.  We also shared the turkey and egg white omelet, which is served with toast (+ butter and jam), hash brown, cherry tomatoes, and avocado.  The omelet was certainly pretty to look at, but a bit bland.  It needed pepper, or hot sauce, or something to give it a little kick.\n\nThe real winner, surprisingly, was the hash brown.  I don't think I've ever had one so crispy and flavorful.  I say this as someone who normally shies away from heavy, carb-laden breakfasts.\n\nService at Mon Ami Gabi is....typical Vegas.  Stiff and not especially friendly.  I don't  expect much else at a restaurant that probably gets zero regulars.\n\nThat said, I think I know exactly where I'm headed next time I need a tasty, healthy, and relatively affordable breakfast on the Strip!  =)","review_id":"tJPW79iScjyfmW-Nv0ffaQ","stars":4,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":5,"useful":8,"user_id":"0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA","date":"2014-05-16"},{"cool":0,"text":"We made a reservation on OpenTable which is only for inside seating, but when we got to our seat we were pleasantly surprised that it was directly in front of the Bellagio fountains and barely inside the restaurant, so it was a perfect table.

The free baguettes are the best part -  the French onion soup and the two apps I tried (escargot and chips with blue cheese dip) were just okay. This is French bistro fare commercialized (those from the Chicago area will know that this is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, all of which I have found to be underwhelming). Service wasn't their strong suit either. When we walked in, around 6PM on a Monday evening, and told them we just wanted some drinks and apps, the hostess said she couldn't seat us for that. After looking around at the 75% empty dining room and probably looking at her strangely, she called her manager to get the OK to seat us. As someone who's worked as a restaurant server, I can tell you that any place should be thrilled to have a table like that - high tab from alcohol and quick turnover. Then our server seemed a bit out of it. So if you're just looking for a reasonably priced place overlooking the Bellagio fountains, Mon Ami will fit the bill, but if you care equally about the food and service, you'll be a bit disappointed.","review_id":"OVb4eqY-b_RQcIRy60I5cQ","stars":3,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w","date":"2009-12-24"},{"cool":1,"text":"I know it's a chain, but it's still one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!\n\nWhen my flight gets in late, no worries, this place is open late.

The salad was smaller than I anticipated, and the presentation made it hard to appreciate all of the elements in a nice bite.

I had the caramelized scallops, for some reason i was in the mood for some, and they were juicy, cooked perfect and had a great flavor to it. A downside was you only got four. I would of liked 6 maybe? not sure what type of scallops they were but i know  they can get pretty expensive, but some are also really cheap.It was accompanied by a veggie fricasse. the actual broth/cream to it was great, if I were to be so critical, my only gripe was that this was a 25$ dish, how about putting some exotic veggies in there maybe? something more than just peas and carrots. The bread/baguette was also good, accompanied with it was a type of tampanade/bruschetta consisting of shredded carrots, green onions maybe and vinegar. either way it complemented it well. The server was also nice enough to bring us a different version of the tampanade which had radish and corn, which was also very good, but i liked the carrots better. Despite the little critical things, I was impressed with everything. A great job by this upscale restaurant or should i say french bistro.","review_id":"lOhMHKqFltA73XgvjxNCRg","stars":4,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":0,"user_id":"3EKm38imhyCk3xcVVQbdZg","date":"2013-08-02"},{"cool":0,"text":"This review is of our experience and not of the food (we didn't get that far).

When I go somewhere like, say, PF Chang's, it's generally the same experience every time. Each experience at Mon Ami has been a different vibe but all equally enjoyable. Over the years, my g.f.'s & I have joked about playing hooky & meeting there for the afternoon. I'd recommend reservations, if possible; otherwise, depending on the day/time, anticipate a bit of a wait. I've never been disappointed by the fare. Leading up to today's celebratory work lunch, I had my tastebuds set on the chicken paillard but made a last minute switch to the prime steak sandwich. Upon my 2nd or 3rd bite, I enthusiastically declared \"I don't even like meat but if it all tasted like THIS, I'd love it!\" There's a misconception that Mon Ami is über pricey but it's really not that much different than going to places like Outback, Cheesecake Factory, (the previously mentioned) PF Chang's, etc. The ambiance is spot-on, even when it's a packed Saturday nite, & the service is consistent. A few items to take into consideration: warm brie cheese appetizer, mussels, chicken paillard, onion soup, quiche, warm chicken & brie sandwich, prime steak sandwich & flourless chocolate cake. Go.

The roast beef was way overcooked and there were very little of it tucked under the poached eggs.

It was apparently that the staff was really being stretched as the simple menus were being distributed and the water glasses filled, our server very politely informed us she'd return shortly to get our drink orders. \n\nAfter about 10 minute as promised she returned and took our drink orders although we were wanting to order a selection of appetizers for the table to share she dashed off to enter our drink orders. Having been seated for a least 20 minutes our drinks arrived and she began taking the appetizer orders avoiding mentioning anything else referencing to placing our dinner orders although we had possession of the menus for at least 30 minutes and the first rounds of drinks were mostly expired. Now we all understood this was a informal business dinner and time wasn't really a concern except for a few that had rather be spending their time at the craps table or feeding the one arm bandits. The appetizers arrived and a second round of refreshments were ordered, after clearing the table of the seafood food selections and distribution of the recently order round of cocktails to the dismay of a few inpatient souls who seemed unimpressed with the evening  and felt the evening was slipping away we finally placed our entree orders. \n\nI will say the oysters were exceptional not only were they fresh and cleanly shucked with the shells still full of the natural liquor, they were sized nicely and delicious as well as plentiful. \n\nAfter more than a hour a half the entrees began arriving after and after being somewhat surprised at how inexpensive the dinner selections were I wasn't that surprised on the quality and in fact was a little disappointed to find such a popular venue didn't have a more upscale selection.

The filet ordered medium rare came out well done and the asparagus was cold and tough. \n\nAlthough the venue was very nice with good service for the amount of customers being crammed in, the food was just okay considering the dinner went on for more than two and a half hours with time for only two cocktails to be served. Several of us chose to exit once the desserts were explained and our gracious host offered this as an option since it was getting rather late in the evening.

We didn't have reservations as I wanted to sit in the outdoor patio, which is served on a first come basis. We were told the wait would be roughly an hour, and were surprised to be seated after 20 or so minutes.\n\nIf you're planning to sit outdoors, be prepared for very tight and cramped seating. The patio is a popular choice and it's like the restaurant wanted to maximize the space and squeeze as many tables in there as possible. But the view of the Bellagio fountains slightly makes it all worth it. One extra star for the view.\n\nI started off with their St. Germaine cocktail ($15), which was light, sweet and refreshing, and Onion Soup Gratin ($11), which was baked with Gruyere cheese. It was heavy and very flavorful, but I couldn't finish it since it was too salty. While my Eggs Benedict ($15) consisted of Canadian bacon, it was very standard and unmemorable. The rest of my party had the Grilled Salmon & Spinach Salad ($20) and Maine Lobster Roll ($18), which seemed to be fairly mediocre as well.\n\nThe service left a lot to be desired. Our server was very friendly and outgoing, but couldn't be found half the time. Maybe it was because it was busy, but we seemed to wait forever for everything, even small requests.\n\nNot too sure if I'd come back, unless I'm in the mood for a bougie al fresco lunch with Bellagio fountain music playing in the background every 15-minutes. If you want decent food for the same price, you're better off at Grand Lux Café. If you want better food with a view and aren't on a budget, go to one of Bellagio's lakefront restaurants.\n\nP.S.

My quiche was perfect, a very good size (medium pizza size) and the egg was creamy and delicious. The crepe was a bit too healthy for me, a wheat type of concoction, but my friend thoroughly enjoyed it. The best part had to be the addition of the french fries. I had read they were like potato chips and they really were. So thin and crispy, anyone who loves crispy fries would love it.

Service was very attentive and our server was a treasure trove of knowledge (we know what the Gabi is about); the tomato fennel soup was creamy and flavorful, poured steaming from a kettle; and the chocolate bread pudding irresistible.

My boyfriend & I came here on our last night in Vegas. We requested outdoor seating and we lucked out with, what I think is, the best seating. We got the corner seating with a PERFECT view of the Bellagio watershow and didn't have numerous people walking back and forth right in front of us. \n\nWe ordered the pate, salmon, steak bearnaise (?), french onion soup. Everything was delicious, very decent sized portions and very filling. I would go into more detail but I'm too lazy. Basically, you can't fail with any of these choices. \n\nThe atmosphere was pretty interesting. Right when you walk into the restaurant, it's pretty dim and seems more like a romantic setting but as you walk toward the outdoor seating, the atmosphere gets more lively. Or maybe that was just my take on it all.\n\nBasically, this is a great place for a date or even for a group to come here. Sitting outside is awesome (but be sure to do it later in the evening when it isn't scorching hot).","review_id":"uxVXOcpI9xafWBp82LLLoA","stars":4,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":1,"useful":4,"user_id":"4eR6hYFJcBHoAqhuOS07ww","date":"2009-07-09"},{"cool":0,"text":"after checking into our hotel we made reservations to grab dinner at monamigabi at paris hotel.  we got there 30minutes early but they had outdoor seating available for us!

(celiacs usually have to just stare at everyone at the table enjoin warm baguettes while drooling but this place is awesome regarding gluten free eaters!) and the scallops i ordered were seared to perfection! my goodness it was delicious and 5 meaty perfect sized scallops were surrounding a pile of ratatouille (I'm not a fan of ratatouille but it was alright)\n\nthe bad was...our server was horrible...he had the worst attitude and was very unhelpful...he forgot our fries and acted like it wasn't a big deal but made a ginormous deal about bringing out complimentary fries 5minutes later.  we also never got refills on $4 sodas.  & one of the salmon salads we ordered came out with a inch long slightly wavy hair (u guess what that was) \n\nill come back...didnt get glutened and loved the view!","review_id":"OSPgFauSiUEgMFUspCQvjA","stars":4,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":0,"useful":2,"user_id":"KavG2RBt77vRLqG1_6RBvQ","date":"2012-07-16"},{"cool":4,"text":"Cute little parisian cafe.

Indoors, you won't be surrounded by people walking by chain-smoking and there's not too much wind, especially when it's a cool day.  The Eggs Benedict and Strawberry waffle were delicious!!!

Had to wait an hour for an outside table but it was so worth the wait (minus the annoying costumed characters harassing tourists on the strip). The escargots were perfect, just like I had in France. I wished they had a bread shop because I'd buy those baguettes and take them home. I had a craving for the steak au jus sandwich and my waiter, Manny told me that item is on the lunch menu but they made it for me anyway. I really appreciated that and it happened to be one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I'm just sorry I didn't have room for dessert.

A lot of reviews noted how long the wait was to get a table, but the five of us were fortunate enough to get seated outside immediately.  While that might have been luck, I'm sure when we were there had something to do with it too - a Monday morning in early February.  Had we been there on a weekend during the summer or spring break instead, it would have been a very different story...and possibly a very different review.\n\nAlthough nothing we had really amazed (except the baguettes...so good!), I thought the food was pretty solid overall (four stars is about right).  Since my friend and I both wanted to try the Sea Scallop Gratinées, we decided to share an order while I went with the Croque Monsieur for myself.\n\n- Sea Scallop Gratinées (sea scallops with caramelized fennel, onion marmalade, and mussel cream) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=mAWQUpEJV5oBmFBVS95EbA) - the scallops were pretty standard, but I really liked the mussel cream, onion, and fennel.  Despite how good it was, I'm not sure I would get it again since I feel like I can find something comparable in SF.\n- Croque Monsieur (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=uHua_ESHqRFwEwM6xZ-KUQ) - pretty damn tasty.  Unlike others I've tried, there was a nice balance between the gruyere and crème fraiche.  The corners of the bread were a little hard and dry, but it's a pretty minor quibble.  And the fries?  Delicious.\n\nWhat made me give them five stars though were their baguettes (yes, that good...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=NoliktR7IHC8B3EkaJBwiQ) and the service.  Our waitress was terrific - accommodating, friendly, and checked on our table quite often.  What stood out though was how honest she was.  When I asked her about the soup du jour (soup of the day - cream of garlic), she actually recommended I skip it since she thought it was pretty salty.  I passed as she suggested, but she was nice enough to bring out a espresso cup of the soup anyways so I could see for myself...and she was right.  Not sure if many other servers would have done the same thing.\n\nConsidering it's The Strip, the lunch prices seemed relatively fair, but I can't say if the same is true for their dinner menu.  Still, the view alone might be worth the money.  With the Bellagio right across the street, I imagine it's pretty awesome to watch their water shows while you eat.  That is, assuming it's on while you're there.  It wasn't for us...","review_id":"zxJGyZS3WbnKN2Ely83SuA","stars":5,"business_id":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","funny":7,"useful":9,"user_id":"JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA","date":"2012-03-14"}],"ProductID":"4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw"}
